You’ve saved ₹1,00,000. How you deploy it can either:

- Sit almost idle in a bank, or  
- Be the **first building block of a 7–8 figure portfolio**.

What you choose depends on:

- Time horizon (when you’ll need the money)
- Risk tolerance
- Whether you already have an emergency fund

---

## Step 1: Check Your Safety Net

Before [investing](https://unstory.app/investing):

- Do you have 3–6 months of expenses in a liquid, safe place?
- Any high-interest credit card/personal loan [debt](https://unstory.app/debt)?

If **no emergency fund** or **high-interest [debt](https://unstory.app/debt) (>15%)**:

- Use part of the ₹1,00,000 for those first.
- Paying off 24% interest is like getting 24% guaranteed returns.

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Time Horizon

**A. Need the money in ≤ 2 years?**  
Go **safe**:

- High-yield saving1254 account
- Short-term FD / [debt](https://unstory.app/debt) funds
- Ultra-short-duration debt mutual funds

Focus: Capital protection > returns.

**B. Need the money in 3–7 years?**  
Go **balanced**:

- Mix of equity + debt funds
- Example: 60% equity index, 40% debt

**C. Horizon of 7+ years (long-term)**  
Go **growth**:

- 80–100% equity index funds

## Model Portfolios for ₹1,00,000

### 1) Safe Option (Short-Term Goal)

- ₹70,000 – High-yield savings / FD
- ₹30,000 – Short-duration debt fund

Expect: 4–7% annual returns with low volatility.

---

### 2) Balanced Option (3–7 Years, Medium Risk)

- ₹60,000 – Equity index funds  
- ₹40,000 – Debt funds

Example:

- ₹30,000 – Nifty 50 / Sensex index fund
- ₹30,000 – Nifty Next 50 / flexicap index
- ₹40,000 – Short/medium duration debt fund

Expect: 7–10% annualized over long term with softer drawdowns.

---

### 3) Aggressive Option (7+ Years, High Risk Tolerance)

- ₹80,000 – Equity index funds
- ₹20,000 – Debt / emergency buffer

Example:

- ₹30,000 – Nifty 50 index
- ₹30,000 – Nifty Next 50 / Nifty 500
- ₹20,000 – International equity ETF / fund-of-fund
- ₹20,000 – Liquid/debt fund

Expect: 10–12% annualized over long term, but with sharp volatility.

---

## SIP vs Lump Sum

With ₹1,00,000 you can:

- **Invest lump sum** (if time horizon is long and you accept volatility)
- Or **stagger over 3–6 months** via weekly/biweekly SIPs

If markets are at all-time highs and you’re nervous, staggering reduces emotional stress.

---

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Putting all ₹1,00,000 in one stock “tip”
- Leaving all of it in a 2–3% [saving](https://unstory.app/saving) account for years
- Trading in and out of positions frequently
- Panic selling during corrections
- Not aligning asset mix to timeline (e.g., 100% equity for 1-year goal)

---

## Key Takeaway

For most people with a long-term [mindset](https://unstory.app/mindset):

1. Keep emergency fund separate
2. Put majority of the ₹1,00,000 into **broad, low-cost index funds**
3. Add small allocation to debt for stability
4. Set up monthly SIPs on top of this lump sum

This single decision, repeated each time you save ₹1,00,000, is how portfolios quietly grow into crores.
