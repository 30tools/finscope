# Jumbo Loan Limits 2026: The Rules for Buying Big

In real estate, crossing the "Conforming Limit" is expensive.
If you borrow more than what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are willing to guarantee, you enter the world of **Jumbo Loans**.

For 2026, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has raised the limits again to keep up with inflation. If you are buying a home over $800k (or $1.2M in high-cost areas), here is what you need to know.

## 2026 Jumbo Loan Limits

*   **Standard Limit:** **$832,750** (for most of the US).
    *   *If your loan is $832,000, it is Conforming (Cheaper/Easier).*
    *   *If your loan is $832,751, it is Jumbo (Harder).*
*   **High-Cost Areas (SF, NYC, LA):** **$1,249,125**.
    *   *In these expensive counties, you can borrow up to $1.25M and still get a "Conforming High-Balance" loan.*

## The "Jumbo" Penalty: Stricter Rules

Because these loans have no government backing, banks take on 100% of the risk. They want to make sure you are good for it.

### 1. Credit Score
*   **Conforming:** 620 minimum.
*   **Jumbo:** **700 - 720 minimum.** (740+ for best rates).

### 2. Down Payment
*   **Conforming:** 3% - 5%.
*   **Jumbo:** **10% - 20% minimum.**
*   *Note:* Some aggressive lenders (like SoFi) offer 10% down Jumbo loans, but the rate will be higher.

### 3. Reserves (Cash in Bank)
*   **Conforming:** None usually required.
*   **Jumbo:** **6-12 months of payments.**
*   *Example:* If your mortgage is $6,000/mo, you must show $36,000 - $72,000 in liquid cash *after* closing.

## 2026 Rates: The Surprise Flip

Historically, Jumbo loans had *higher* rates.
In 2026, Jumbo rates are often **LOWER** than conforming rates (approx 6.0% - 6.25%).
*   **Why?** Banks hold Jumbo loans on their own books. They want wealthy clients (like you) so they can cross-sell you wealth management services. They offer "teaser rates" on Jumbo mortgages to get you in the door.

## Verdict

If you are on the borderline (e.g., borrowing $850k), do the math:
1.  **Split the Loan:** Take a conforming loan for $832,750 and a second "piggyback" HELOC for the remaining $17,250. This avoids Jumbo requirements.
2.  **Pay Down:** Increase your down payment to get under the limit.

In 2026, the "Jumbo" market is friendly, but only if your financial documentation is flawless.
