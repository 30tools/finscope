## How a Rollover Works

You cannot just buy gold coins and put them in your safe at home. That is considered a "distribution" and you will be taxed instantly.

**The Process:**
1.  **Open Self-Directed IRA:** You need a specialized custodian (e.g., Equity Trust).
2.  **Transfer Funds:** Move money from your Vanguard/Fidelity 401(k) to the new custodian. (Direct Transfer = No taxes).
3.  **Buy Metals:** You instruct the custodian to buy IRS-approved gold from a dealer.
4.  **Storage:** The metal is shipped to a secured vault (Delaware Depository or Brink's).

## 2026 Fee Guide: What Does It Cost?

The "Gold IRA" is expensive to maintain compared to an ETF like GLD.

| Fee Type | Typical Cost | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Fee** | $50 - $200 | One-time fee. Often waived for large deposits ($50k+). |
| **Annual Maintenance** | $100 - $300 | Paid to the custodian every year. |
| **Storage Fee** | $100 - $200 | Paid to the vault. Segregated storage costs more. |
| **Spread (The Hidden Fee)** | **1% - 5%** | **CRITICAL.** Limits how much gold you get. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Beware the "Spread"**
> If Gold spot price is $2,700/oz, a dealer might sell it to your IRA for $2,850. That difference is the "spread." Unethical dealers charge 10-20% spreads. **Always ask: "What is the spread over spot?"**
