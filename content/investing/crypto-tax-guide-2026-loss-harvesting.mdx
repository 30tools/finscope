# Crypto Tax Guide 2026: Surviving the New IRS Rules

For years, crypto investors operated in a "Wild West" of tax reporting. The IRS has officially closed the saloon doors.

In 2026, the **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)** is fully in effect. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken are now required to send you (and the IRS) **Form 1099-DA**, exposing every trade, stake, and swap you made.

This guide explains the new rules and the one massive loophole that might still exist: **Loss Harvesting.**

## The Big Change: Form 1099-DA

Starting Jan 1, 2026, brokers must report your **Cost Basis**.
*   **Old Way:** You calculated your own profits using Koinly or Excel.
*   **New Way:** The exchange tells the IRS exactly what you paid for that Bitcoin. If your tax return doesn't match their form, you get flagged for an audit.

### What This Means for You
You must stop moving crypto between wallets without tracking it. If you move 1 BTC from Ledger to Coinbase to sell, Coinbase might report the cost basis as $0 (implying 100% profit), landing you with a massive tax bill unless you prove otherwise.

## The "Wash Sale" Rule: Does It Apply in 2026?

**Current Status:** As of early 2026, the "Wash Sale Rule" (which prevents selling a stock at a loss and buying it back within 30 days) **DOES NOT** officially apply to crypto, but legislation is pending.

### The Strategy: Tax Loss Harvesting
Because crypto is treated as property (not a security), you can theoretically:
1.  Sell Bitcoin at a $5,000 loss on Dec 30th.
2.  Buy it back on Dec 31st.
3.  **Claim the $5,000 loss** to offset other capital gains.

> [!WARNING]
> **The "Economic Substance" Doctrine**
> Even if the Wash Sale rule isn't law, the IRS can disallow your loss if they claim the transaction lacked "economic substance."
> *   *Safe Play:* Wait at least 24 hours between selling and re-buying. Don't do it instantly.

## Staking Taxes: The Nightmare

In 2026, staking rewards are taxed as **Income** the second you receive them.
*   *Scenario:* You earn 1 ETH from staking when ETH is $5,000.
*   *Tax:* You owe income tax on $5,000.
*   *Problem:* If ETH drops to $2,000 later, you still owe tax on the $5,000 value.
*   **Solution:** Sell a portion of your staking rewards immediately upon receipt to cover the tax liability.

## Verdict

2026 is the year of **compliance**.
1.  Stop using 15 different wallets if you can't track them.
2.  Use software like **CoinTracker** or **Koinly** to sync your cost basis across all chains.
3.  Harvest losses aggressively while the loophole remains open, but do it carefully.
