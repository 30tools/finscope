## The Golden Rule of Dividends: Don't Chase Yield
In 2026, a 15% dividend yield is usually a "Value Trap." It means the stock price is crashing because the company is in trouble.
**Aim for the Sweet Spot:** **3% to 5%**. Anything higher requires deep investigation into the payout ratio.

## Verdict
If you are just starting, put your first $1,000 into **SCHD**. It's the safest way to see "Mailbox Money" hit your account every three months. As you get more experienced, add "Dividend Kings" like **Coca-Cola** to anchor your portfolio.
