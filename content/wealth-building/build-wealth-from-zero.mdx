Building wealth is not magic. It’s a repeatable system: **earn → save → invest → repeat**.

Most people never build serious wealth because they:
- Don’t increase their income,
- Spend everything they earn,
- Invest randomly or not at all,
- Quit after 1–2 years instead of 10–20.

This roadmap fixes that, step by step.

## Step 1: Increase Your Earning Power

You can’t save your way to wealth on a very low income. The first lever is **income**.

### A. Negotiate Your Salary

A single raise compounds for decades.

- 10% raise on ₹8L → ₹80k extra/year
- Over 10 years (without promotion) → ₹8L extra
- If you invest even half → huge compounding

Basic script:

> “Based on my contribution to X and Y, and market data for this role in [location], I believe a compensation of ₹[amount] would be fair. Can we discuss aligning my salary with my responsibilities and performance?”

### B. Change Jobs Strategically

Switching companies often gives **15–30% jumps**, especially in [tech](https://unstory.app/tech)/finance.

- Keep a tight portfolio (GitHub, blog, LinkedIn)
- Apply for roles that pay at or above market
- Don’t be afraid of “I’m not 100% qualified” – nobody is

### C. Layer Side Income

Even ₹20k/month extra changes everything:

- Freelance dev/writing/design
- Building small SaaS tools
- Selling templates, courses, or digital products

**Action:**  
Pick ONE primary income lever (raise, job switch, or side hustle) and focus on it for **6–12 months**.

## Step 2: Stop Lifestyle Inflation

Lifestyle inflation = when income goes up, but [saving](https://unstory.app/saving)s rate stays the same (or gets worse).

Formula that kills wealth:

> Income ↑ → EMI ↑ → dine-out ↑ → gadgets ↑ → savings = 0

Instead use this rule:

> **Raise Split Rule:**  
> When you get more income, split it:  
> - 50% to lifestyle upgrades  
> - 50% to investments/savings

Example (monthly):

- Old income: ₹60,000
- New income: ₹80,000
- Raise: ₹20,000

Apply rule:
- ₹10,000 → better lifestyle (nicer rent, trips, etc.)
- ₹10,000 → SIPs, index funds, or HYSA

Do this for every raise = your **savings rate keeps rising automatically**.

## Step 3: Build an Emergency Fund (Safety First)

Before you go hard on [investing](https://unstory.app/investing), build a buffer.

### How Much?

Use this table:

| Situation                                | Recommended Fund           |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Dual income, no kids                    | 3 months of expenses       |
| Single income or dependents             | 6 months of expenses       |
| Self-employed / variable income         | 9–12 months of expenses    |

If essential expenses = ₹40,000/month:

- 3 months → ₹1.2L
- 6 months → ₹2.4L
- 12 months → ₹4.8L

### Where to Keep It?

- High-yield savings account (flexible, low risk)
- Don’t put emergency fund in:
  - Stocks
  - Crypto
  - Illiquid assets

**Rule:**  
Emergency fund is for **unexpected, necessary** expenses, not “iPhone on discount” or vacations.

## Step 4: Automate Investments (Wealth Engine)

Once you have basic safety, start [investing](https://unstory.app/investing) **every single month**.

### The Simple Portfolio

If you want something easy:

- 80% – Broad market equity index fund / ETF  
- 20% – Bonds / [debt](https://unstory.app/debt) fund / fixed income

If you are young (20s/early 30s) and okay with volatility:

- 100% – Equity index funds / ETFs

### Why Index Funds/ETFs?

- They own **hundreds/thousands of companies**
- Historically 8–12% annualized returns over long term
- Low fees (`<0.2%` vs 1–2% in many active funds)

### Automation System

Treat investing like a bill:

1. Salary comes in
2. On T+1, auto-debit:
   - X% → SIPs (index funds/ETFs)
   - Optionally → NPS/retirement accounts
3. Spend what’s left

Don’t “invest what’s left”, **spend what’s left**.

## Step 5: Scale and Repeat

Wealth is built in **decades**, not months.

Your job:

- Every year:
  - Increase income
  - Maintain or increase savings rate
  - Keep investing

Eventually, compounding takes over:

- First ₹10L invested feels slow
- First ₹50L you notice something happening
- After ₹1Cr invested, market moves can create or destroy your **yearly salary in a month**

---

## Example Wealth Timelines

Assume 10% annual return (historical equity average), monthly investing, 25–30 years horizon.

### Scenario 1 – ₹10,000/month

- Per year: ₹1,20,000
- 30 years → invested: ₹36,00,000
- Future value ~₹2–2.5 crore

### Scenario 2 – ₹25,000/month

- Per year: ₹3,00,000
- 30 years → invested: ₹90,00,000
- Future value ~₹5–6.5 crore

### Scenario 3 – ₹50,000/month

- Per year: ₹6,00,000
- 30 years → invested: ₹1.8 crore
- Future value ~₹10–13 crore

The **math of wealth** is simple. The hard part is **behavior and consistency**.

## Common Wealth-Building Mistakes

- Waiting to start (“when I earn more”)  
- Chasing hot tips instead of simple index investing  
- Taking on EMIs for lifestyle (car, phone, furniture) instead of assets  
- Not tracking expenses at all  
- Panic-selling during market dips

## Key Takeaway

Wealth from zero follows a boring system:

1. Increase earning power  
2. Avoid lifestyle inflation  
3. Build emergency fund  
4. Automate long-term investing  
5. Repeat for 10–30 years  

You don’t have to be a genius. You have to be **consistent**.
