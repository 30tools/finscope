# Biohacking on a Budget 2026: High-End Health for $100/mo

Bryan Johnson spends $2 Million a year to stay young.
You probably don't have that.

But in 2026, the "Biohacking Bubble" has burst. The tech that used to cost thousands is now available for the price of a Netflix subscription. You can get 80% of the longevity results for &lt;1% of the cost.

Here is your 2026 "Budget Biohacker" protocol.

## 1. The Sleep Stack ($30/mo)
Sleep is the ultimate biohack. In 2026, we focus on **Temperature** and **Magnesium**.
*   **The Hack:** Use a "Chest Freezer" or just a cooling mattress topper.
*   **The Supplement:** **Magnesium Threonate**. It is the only form that reliably crosses the blood-brain barrier.
*   **Cost:** ~$34 for a 2-month supply.

## 2. Light Regulation ($0/mo)
Your circadian rhythm is governed by the sun.
*   **The Hack:** 10 minutes of direct sunlight in your eyes within 30 minutes of waking up. This sets your cortisol and melatonin timers for the day.
*   **The Night Hack:** Download **f.lux** for your computer and use "Night Shift" on your phone.
*   **Cost:** $0.

## 3. Heat & Cold ($10/mo)
*   **Sauna:** If you can't afford a $5,000 infrared sauna, join a local YMCA or community gym for ~$40/mo. Three 20-minute sessions a week reduce cardiovascular death risk by 40%.
*   **Cold Plunge:** Don't buy a $10,000 Plunge. Get a $100 stock tank from a farm supply store or just take **Cold Showers**. 2 minutes of shivering is all you need for the dopamine spike.

## 4. The Data ($15/mo)
You can't manage what you don't measure.
*   **The Device:** Buy a used **Whoop** or **Oura Ring** (v3) on eBay. In 2026, many people have upgraded to the latest tech and are selling their perfectly good older models for &lt;$100.
*   **The Metrics:** Focus solely on **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)** and **Deep Sleep**.
