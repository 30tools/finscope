# The 2025 Flu: Why This Year Feels Different

If it feels like everyone you know is sick right now, you aren't imagining things. The 2025 flu season is proving to be particularly aggressive, driven largely by the **H3N2 variant**. Doctors are warning that this strain hits harder and faster than usual.

## The Key Symptoms
Unlike a "slow burn" cold, the 2025 flu tends to strike suddenly—like being hit by a truck.
*   **Rapid Onset Fever**: Spiking to 103°F–104°F within hours.
*   **GI Issues**: Unusually, this strain is causing more **vomiting and diarrhea**, especially in children, which is often confused with a stomach bug.
*   **Severe Body Aches**: Intense muscle pain that makes it difficult to get out of bed.
*   **Chesty Cough**: A deep, persistent cough that lingers.

## When to Seek Help
*   If a fever lasts more than 3 days.
*   If you experience difficulty breathing.
*   If you cannot keep fluids down (risk of dehydration).

## Prevention
The flu shot remains your best defense, reducing the severity of symptoms even if you do get infected. Wash your hands, wear a mask in crowded places, and stay home if you feel "off."
