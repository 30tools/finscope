Want to burn fat while you sleep? **Tesamorelin**.
Want to reverse your biological age? **Epitalon**.

But luxury health comes with a luxury price tag. Here is what you will pay in 2026.

## The "Insurance Gap": Is it Covered?

In 2026, the answer is still generally **NO.**
*   **Why?** Insurance companies view peptide therapy as "elective" or "compounded." Unless a peptide is an FDA-approved drug for a specific disease (like insulin or some GLP-1s for diabetes), they won't pay.
*   **The Exception:** Some high-end executive health plans vary. If your peptide is prescribed for a diagnosed deficiency (like HGH deficiency), you *might* get 50% coverage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Compound Pharmacies vs. Online Research Sites**
> You can buy peptides from "Research Only" sites for 80% less. **DON'T.** In 2026, these sites often sell impure or under-dosed products. Always get your peptides through a licensed clinic and a US-based compounding pharmacy.

## 3 Ways to Save Money in 2026

1.  **Subscription Models:** Many clinics (like Lifeforce or Valhalla Vitality) offer memberships that lower the "per vial" cost by 20%.
2.  **HSA/FSA Eligible:** Even if insurance won't pay, you can usually use your **Health Savings Account** to pay for the consultation and the peptides, saving you ~30% in taxes.
3.  **Oral Peptides:** While slightly less effective than injections, oral versions of BPC-157 are often $50-100 cheaper per month.

## Verdict
Peptide therapy is an investment in your "Biological Real Estate." Expect to spend **$250 - $500/month** for a solid protocol. It's expensive, but compared to the cost of surgery or chronic medication, many biohackers consider it a bargain.
