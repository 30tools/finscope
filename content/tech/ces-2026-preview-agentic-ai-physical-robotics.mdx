## Major Theme: Agentic AI
We are moving beyond Large Language Models (LLMs) to **Large Action Models (LAMs)**. 
*   **What it is:** Instead of just telling you how to book a flight, "Agentic AI" will autonomously navigate apps, handle payment, and schedule your calendar without human intervention.
*   **Key Players:** Expect major announcements from **Lenovo**, **Samsung**, and **Microsoft** on OS-level AI agents that reside directly on your hardware.

## Physical Robotics & Humanoids
This is the year of the **Humanoid Home Assistant**.
1.  **Samsung & LG:** Rumors suggest they will unveil robots designed for aging-in-place, capable of picking up objects and monitoring [health](https://unstory.app/health) vitals.
2.  **Unitree & Boston Dynamics:** Look for more accessible, consumer-grade bipedal robots that cost less than a small car.

## The Silicon Race
Chip manufacturers are fighting for dominance in "On-Device AI."
*   **AMD:** CEO Lisa Su is expected to announce the **Ryzen 9000 Series AI** chips with 100+ TOPS of NPU performance.
*   **Nvidia:** The gaming world is buzzing about the rumored **RTX 5090 "Super" refresh**, designed specifically to handle massive local AI models for real-time game generation.

## Digital Health 2.0
We’ve moved past simple step counting. 
*   **Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring:** Multiple startups are expected to showcase wearables that accurately track blood sugar without needles.
*   **Cognitive Twins:** AI that monitors your speech patterns to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s.

**CES 2026 isn't just a gadget show; it's a preview of a world where technology isn't just a tool, but a proactive partner.**
