# PS5 Pro Review: The Powerhouse Console for 2026

## Specs Recap
*   **GPU:** 16.7 Teraflops (vs 10.3 on base PS5).
*   **AI Upscaling:** PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) delivers near 4K at 60FPS.
*   **Ray Tracing:** 2-3x faster than the original model.

## Performance in 2025 Games
Games like *Ghost of Yotei* and *Death Stranding 2* have showcased the Pro's muscle.
*   **Base PS5:** Struggles to hold 60FPS in "Quality Mode."
*   **PS5 Pro:** Locks to 60FPS with better texture clarity thanks to PSSR.

## The GTA 6 Factor
The biggest argument for buying a PS5 Pro now is **Grand Theft Auto VI**. Set for late 2026, GTA 6 is expected to push current-gen hardware to its absolute limit. If you want the definitive console experience for that game, the PS5 Pro is your only choice.

## Verdict
At the discounted price of $649, the PS5 Pro is a solid buy for enthusiasts. For casual gamers playing Fortnite or FC 26, the standard PS5 remains sufficient.
