# Nintendo Switch 2: Launch Titles & Specs (2026)

**Kyoto, Jan 3, 2026:** The drought is over. Nintendo's successor to the 2017 Switch has arrived (or is arriving imminently).

It is not a revolution; it is an **evolution**.

## The Hardware
*   **Screen:** 8-inch OLED (Standard).
*   **Power:** Comparable to a PS4 Pro, but with NVIDIA DLSS [tech](https://unstory.app/tech) that allows it to upscale to 4K on your TV.
*   **Backward Compatibility:** YES. Your old cartridges work.

## The Launch Lineup (2026)

### 1. Mario Kart 9 (Crossroads)
It has been 12 years since Mario Kart 8. The new game is rumored to feature characters from *all* Nintendo franchises (Zelda, Star Fox, Kirby) fully integrated.

### 2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond
It really exists. It looks stunning.

### 3. Pokemon Legends: Z-A
Game Freak's ambitious open-world title set in Lumiose City.

## Verdict
Nintendo isn't trying to beat the PS5 Pro on power. They are beating them on **Fun**. The Switch 2 is an instant buy.
