## Release Date: February 2026
While some early rumors suggested a January launch to compete with the iPhone 17, reliable supply chain leakers now point to a **Galaxy Unpacked event in mid-February 2026**, with retail availability starting in March.

## The Heart: Snapdragon 8 Gen 5
The biggest upgrade is under the hood. The S26 Ultra will likely feature the **Snapdragon 8 Gen 5**, manufactured on a cutting-edge **2nm process**.
*   **Efficiency:** Estimated 30% longer battery life compared to the S25 Ultra.
*   **AI Performance:** Dedicated silicon for running "Agentic AI" locally, allowing for real-time voice translation and complex photo editing without an internet connection.

## Camera: 300MP Main Sensor?
Samsung is reportedly moving beyond its 200MP sensor to a **300MP ISOCELL** powerhouse. 
*   **Zoom:** Rumors suggest a "Variable Zoom" lens that can shift between 3x and 10x optical zoom without secondary lenses.
*   **Video:** 8K at 120FPS is finally on the table, perfect for creators using the PS5 Pro's high-fidelity output.

## Design Changes
Expect a "Slimmer but Stronger" approach. Titanium remains the material of choice, but with a new "Satin finish" that is more resistant to fingerprints. The screen is rumored to be the brightest ever on a phone, reaching **4,500 nits** of peak brightness.

**Verdict:** The S26 Ultra looks set to be the "Hardware King" of 2026. If you are due for an upgrade, waiting until February seems like the smart move.
