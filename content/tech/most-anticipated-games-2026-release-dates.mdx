# Most Anticipated Games of 2026: GTA 6, Witcher 4 & More

**Jan 3, 2026:** 2025 was a great year for gaming, but 2026 is the year of the **Titans**. The delaying of several blockbusters has created a massive pile-up of AAA releases.

## 1. Grand Theft Auto VI (Nov 19, 2026)
The elephant in the room. Release date is set. Rockstar is returning to Vice City (Florida).
*   **The Hype:** It's expected to be the highest-grossing entertainment launch in human history.
*   **Platforms:** PS5, Xbox Series X (PC likely 2027).

## 2. The Witcher 4: Polaris (Late 2026)
CD Projekt Red begins their new saga.
*   **Engine:** Built on Unreal Engine 5.
*   **Story:** Not Geralt. A new school (Lynx School).

## 3. Mass Effect 5 (N7 Day 2026?)
BioWare teased it for years. 2026 is when we likely see the return to the Milky Way galaxy.

## 4. Star Wars Jedi 3
The conclusion to Cal Kestis's trilogy. Respawn Entertainment has proven they understand Jedi combat better than anyone.

## Verdict
Start saving money now. Between a $70 price tag (maybe rising to $80?) and the need for console upgrades, 2026 will be expensive for gamers.
