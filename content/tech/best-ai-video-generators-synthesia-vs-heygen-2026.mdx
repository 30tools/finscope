## 1. Synthesia (The Corporate Choice)
Synthesia feels like a high-end production studio. It is built for big teams.
*   **Pros:** The "Studio Avatars" are 4K quality. It has built-in SCORM support (for LMS).
*   **Cons:** It is stricter. You can't just clone anyone instantly; they have strict KYC to prevent deepfakes.
*   **Verdict:** If you are making Compliance Training for 500 employees, use Synthesia.

## 2. HeyGen (The Creator Choice)
HeyGen moves fast. It is the tool that went viral for "Instant Translation" (making a video speak French with your original voice).
*   **Pros:** The **"Instant Avatar"** feature allows you to clone yourself with a webcam in 2 minutes. It is perfect for personalized sales outreach.
*   **Cons:** The credit system can be confusing if you generate a lot of short clips.
*   **Verdict:** If you are sending 50 sales videos a day or running a TikTok channel, use HeyGen.

## The Feature: Video Translation
In 2026, **Dubbing** is the killer app.
*   **HeyGen's Video Translate** changes your lip movements to match the new language. It is uncanny.
*   **Cost:** Both platforms charge extra "credits" for this, but HeyGen is generally cheaper for bulk translation.

## Verdict: Which One?

*   **Choose Synthesia if:** You prioritize safety, compliance, and "polished" consistent avatars for long-term courses.
*   **Choose HeyGen if:** You want speed, viral features (like custom motion), and personalized sales content.
