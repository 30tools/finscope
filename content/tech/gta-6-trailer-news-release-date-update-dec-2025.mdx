## Trailer 3 Status
Despite rampant internet rumors predicting a "Christmas Surprise," Rockstar has **not released Trailer 3** in December 2025.
*   **Precedent:** Trailer 2 dropped in May 2025.
*   **Prediction:** Analysts expect the next major marketing beat—likely showcasing gameplay mechanics or online features—to arrive in **Q1 2026**.

## Release Date
The game is officially scheduled for **Fall 2026** (specifically widely rumored for November).
*   **Platforms:** PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.
*   **PC Version:** No date announced yet, likely 2027 or 2028.

## Leaks vs. Reality
Be wary of "leaked" map images circulating on X (formerly Twitter). Most have been debunked as fan-made concepts using Unreal Engine 5. The only verified footage remains the two official trailers released by Rockstar.

**Bottom Line:** Patience is key. We are now less than a year away from the biggest entertainment launch in history.
