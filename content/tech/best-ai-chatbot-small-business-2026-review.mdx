Customers want answers in 24 **seconds**.

## 1. Intercom Fin
**Best For:** Professional SaaS and established companies.
*   **The Cost:** ~$0.99 per resolution.
*   **The Magic:** Fin is a "no-hallucination" bot. It only answers using your verified documentation. If it doesn't know, it passes to a human.
*   **ROI:** If you pay a support agent $20/hr and they solve 10 tickets, your cost is $2/ticket. Fin does it for half that, 24/7.

## 2. Chatbase
**Best For:** Solopreneurs and Small Websites.
*   **The Cost:** Starts at ~$19/mo.
*   **The Magic:** You just upload a PDF or a website URL, and 2 minutes later, you have a chatbot that knows everything about your brand.
*   **Pros:** Incredibly fast to set up. You can embed it on any site with one line of code.
*   **Verdict:** The best "bang for buck" in 2026.

## 3. Zendesk AI (Answer Bot)
**Best For:** Enterprises with massive ticket volume.
*   **The Cost:** Bundled with Zendesk Suite (starts at ~$55/mo).
*   **The Magic:** It predicts the *intent* of the customer. It can spot "Frustrated" customers and escalate them to a manager before they even ask.
*   **Verdict:** Use this if you already use Zendesk as your CRM.
