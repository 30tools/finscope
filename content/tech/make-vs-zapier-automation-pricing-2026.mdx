# Make vs Zapier 2026: The Automation Showdown

Zapier is the Xerox of automation—everyone knows the name. But **Make** (formerly Integromat) is the secret weapon of engineers.

In 2026, automation is non-negotiable. But paying $500/mo for it is.
Here is the definitive breakdown of cost and capability.

## The Core Difference: "Linear" vs "Visual"

*   **Zapier (Linear):** "If This, Then That." It is a straight line. Great for simple tasks (New Lead -> Add to Slack).
*   **Make (Visual):** It looks like a mind map. You can have branches, loops, and routers. "If Lead is > $10k, go here. If < $10k, go there."

## 2026 Pricing Comparison

| Feature | **Zapier** | **Make** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free Plan** | 100 Tasks/mo | 1,000 Operations/mo |
| **Starter Price** | ~$29/mo (750 Tasks) | ~$9/mo (10,000 Ops) |
| **Value** | Low | **High** |
| **Ease of Use** | Very Easy | Medium (L[earning](https://unstory.app/earning) Curve) |

### The "Task" vs "Operation" Trap
*   **Zapier:** A 5-step automation counts as 5 tasks.
*   **Make:** A 5-step automation counts as 5 operations.
*   **The Math:** Make gives you **10x more operations** for **1/3rd of the price**.

> [!TIP]
> **Why pay for Zapier?**
> Zapier connects to **7,000+ apps**. Make connects to ~2,400. If you use an obscure niche tool, Zapier is the only game in town.

## When to Switch to Make?
If your Zapier bill hits **$100/month**, it is time to switch. You can likely replicate the same workflow in Make for **$16/month**.
Yes, the interface is scarier at first (it looks like a circuit board), but the saving2082 are massive for high-volume users.

## Verdict

*   **Beginner:** Stick with **Zapier**. The time you save not learning a new tool is worth the higher fee.
*   **Pro/Agency:** Switch to **Make**. You can build "Products" (entire back-end applications) on Make that simply aren't possible on Zapier.
