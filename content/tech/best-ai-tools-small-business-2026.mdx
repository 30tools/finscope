## 1. The Writer: Jasper (formerly Jarvis)
**Best For:** Marketing Copy & SEO Blogs.
*   **2026 Update:** Jasper now integrates with your brand voice. You upload your past emails, and it writes *exactly* like you.
*   **Cost:** ~$39/mo.
*   **Verdict:** Better than ChatGPT for "selling" because it is trained on high-converting sales copy.

## 2. The Artist: Midjourney v7
**Best For:** Website Images & Ad Creatives.
*   **Quality:** In 2026, Midjourney images are indistinguishable from photography. No more stock photos.
*   **Cost:** ~$10/mo.
*   **Verdict:** Essential for Facebook Ads and Blog headers.

## 3. The Assistant: Motion
**Best For:** Calendar & Project Management.
*   **Magic:** It actively re-schedules your day. If a meeting runs late, Motion automatically moves your "Deep Work" block to an open slot.
*   **Cost:** ~$19/mo.
*   **Verdict:** It saves 2 hours of "admin planning" every week.

## 4. The Analyst: ChatGPT Team
**Best For:** Everything.
*   **Use Case:** Upload your Excel P&L and ask: *"Where am I wasting money?"* The data analysis features in 2026 are CFO-level.
*   **Cost:** $25/seat/mo.

## 5. The Video Maker: Descript
**Best For:** Editing Social Media Clips.
*   **Feature:** "Overdub." You can type text, and it generates audio in your own voice to fix mistakes without re-recording.
*   **Cost:** ~$12/mo.

## 6. The Meeting Note Taker: Fireflies.ai
**Best For:** Zoom/Teams Calls.
*   **Magic:** It joins your calls, records them, and sends a summary to your CRM.
*   **Cost:** Free tier available.

## The "All-In" Cost
To run a $1M business in 2026, your software bill is:
*   Jasper: $39
*   Midjourney: $10
*   Motion: $19
*   ChatGPT: $25
*   **Total: ~$93/month.**

Compare that to hiring one virtual assistant ($2,000/mo). AI isn't replacing you; it's promoting you to CEO.
