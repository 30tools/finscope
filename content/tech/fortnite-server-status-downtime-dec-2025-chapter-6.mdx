## Current Status (Dec 29)
*   **Servers:** **Online** (Green).
*   **Matchmaking:** Slight delays reported in Zero Build queues.
*   **Login:** Stable.

## Recent Downtime
Epic Games took servers offline briefly on Dec 27 for a hotfix to address a glitch with the "Snowball Launcher" item. No further scheduled downtime is expected until the next major patch (v33.20) in mid-January 2026.

## What's New in Chapter 6?
*   **New Map:** The "Helios" map update has been well-received.
*   **First Person Mode:** Finally fully integrated into Battle Royale modes.
*   **Winterfest:** Claim your free daily gifts from the Lodge before Jan 2nd!

**Troubleshooting:** If you cannot connect, checking your own internet (NAT type) is recommended, as Epic's systems are currently reporting nominal performance.
