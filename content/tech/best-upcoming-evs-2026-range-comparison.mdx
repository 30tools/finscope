## 1. Lucid Gravity (The Range King)
*   **Range:** 440 miles.
*   **Price:** $80,000.
*   **Verdict:** The SUV version of the Air. Incredible [tech](https://unstory.app/tech), luxury interior, but uncertain company stability.

## 2. Rivian R2
*   **Range:** 330 miles.
*   **Price:** $45,000.
*   **Verdict:** The "Baby R1S." Rugged, stylish, and finally affordable. This is the car that will challenge the Model Y's dominance in 2026.

## 3. Tesla "Model 2" (Redwood)
*   **Range:** 270 miles.
*   **Price:** $25,000.
*   **Status:** Production hell. Rumored for late 2026.
*   **Verdict:** If it ships, it changes everything.

## Battery Tech: Solid State?
Toyota claims their solid-state battery is coming in late 2027. For 2026, we are still on Lithium-Ion, but optimized to perfection.
