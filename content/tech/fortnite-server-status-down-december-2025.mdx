# Fortnite Status Check: Servers Stabilize After Holiday Crash

Gamers trying to drop into the island this past Christmas were met with frustration, but there is good [news](https://unstory.app/news) today.

## Current Status: **ONLINE**
As of **December 27, 2025**, all systems are operational. Matchmaking, login, and the Item Shop are functioning normally across all platforms (PS5, Xbox, PC, Switch).

## What Happened?
*   **Dec 24-25 Outage**: A massive influx of players over the holiday caused significant server instability. Players reported "Login Failed" errors and long queue times.
*   **The Fix**: Epic Games deployed a hotfix late on Dec 26 that resolved the authentication issues.

## Troubleshooting
If you are still experiencing issues:
1.  Restart your game client.
2.  Check for a pending update (there was a small patch yesterday).
3.  Test your own internet connection, as the servers are green.
