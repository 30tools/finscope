# PS5 Pro Review: A Powerhouse with a Premium Price

Sony's mid-cycle refresh, the **PS5 Pro**, launched in late 2024, and now that we've had time to live with it through the 2025 holiday season, the verdict is in. It is the most powerful console ever made—but it's not for everyone.

## The Specs
*   **GPU**: Roughly 45% faster rendering than the base PS5.
*   **PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution)**: This is the game-changer. It uses AI to upscale images, allowing games to run at 4K resolution *and* 60fps simultaneously.
*   **Storage**: A generous 2TB SSD comes standard.

## The Performance
In enhanced titles like *GTA VI* (the trailer alone broke the internet) and *Ghost of Yotei*, the difference is stark. Lighting is more realistic, reflections are crystal clear, and the frame rate holds steady.

## The Verdict
*   **Buy it if**: You have a high-end 4K/120Hz TV and money is no object. It’s the ultimate way to play.
*   **Skip it if**: You have a 1080p TV or are happy with the standard PS5. The $700 price tag is steep, especially since it doesn't include a disc drive.
