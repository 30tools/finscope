# Affordable EVs 2026: Chevy Bolt, Equinox & The Under $30k Market

**Detroit, Jan 3, 2026:** For a decade, the "Affordable EV" was a myth. You either bought a Tesla for $50k or a golf cart.

In 2026, the gap has filled. Legacy automakers, threatened by cheap Chinese imports (BYD), have finally released good, cheap electric cars.

## 1. Chevrolet Bolt (The King Returns)
GM brought it back.
*   **Price:** Starts at $28,995.
*   **Range:** 259 miles.
*   **Tech:** Uses the new Ultium LFP battery tech for faster charging.
*   **Verdict:** The best value car in America, period.

## 2. Chevrolet Equinox EV
*   **Price:** $34,995.
*   **Range:** 319 miles.
*   **Verdict:** A properly sized family SUV that undercuts the Tesla Model Y by $10,000.

## 3. Volvo EX30
*   **Price:** $36,000.
*   **Vibe:** Scandinavian minimalism. Fast, stylish, but a bit cramped in the back seat.

## The Tax Credit
In 2026, the $7,500 US Federal Tax Credit is now "Point of Sale."
*   **Meaning:** The dealer takes $7,500 off the sticker price *immediately*. A $29k Bolt becomes a $21.5k car.

## Verdict
There are no more excuses. An EV is now cheaper to buy and cheaper to fuel than a Toyota Corolla.
