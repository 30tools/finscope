# A New Face in Hawkins: Holly Wheeler Recast for Season 5

Eagle-eyed fans of *Stranger Things* noticed a significant change in the Wheeler household in Season 5. **Holly Wheeler**, the youngest sibling previously played by twins Anniston and Tinsley Price, has been recast.

## The New Actress
The role is now played by **Nell Fisher**, a talented young actress known for her standout performance in *Evil Dead Rise* (2023).

## Why the Change?
The decision was purely narrative-driven.
*   **A Bigger Role**: In previous seasons, Holly was largely a background character. In Season 5, she is central to the plot—specifically in the episode titled "**The Vanishing of Holly Wheeler**."
*   **Maturity Required**: The storyline required an actress with more extensive acting experience to handle the complex, emotional (and likely terrifying) scenes demanded by the finale.

## What to Expect
Fisher's casting confirms that the stakes are higher than ever for the Wheeler family. Rumors suggest Holly becomes a target for Vecna, forcing Nancy and Mike to race against time to save their little sister.
