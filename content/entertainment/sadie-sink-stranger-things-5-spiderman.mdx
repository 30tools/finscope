# Sadie Sink's Big Year: From Hawkins to the Spider-Verse

**Sadie Sink** is having a moment. As fans anxiously await the conclusion of [Max Mayfield](https://unstory.app/trending/max-mayfield-fate-stranger-things-season-5-sadie-sink)'s harrowing journey in *Stranger Things*, the actress is already swinging into her next blockbuster franchise.

## Stranger Things: Max's Fate
Season 5 finds Max in a precarious position—trapped in Vecna's mind lair.
*   **The Tease**: Sink recently described the upcoming finale (releasing Dec 31) as a "homecoming."
*   **The stakes**: Max is the key to defeating Vecna, but her physical body remains in a coma. Her mental battle will be one of the season's most critical plotlines.

## Next Stop: Spider-Man
Looking ahead to 2026, Sink is set to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe in **Spider-Man: Brand New Day**.
*   **The Role**: Details are top-secret, but Sink joked that keeping Marvel secrets is "even harder" than protecting *Stranger Things* spoilers.
*   **Release Date**: July 2026.

## Career Trajectory
Sink has successfully transitioned from child star to A-list talent. With *The Whale* and now *Spider-Man* on her resume, she is poised to be one of Hollywood's leading faces for the next decade.
