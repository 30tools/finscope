# Macaulay Culkin's Net Worth: Still Living the Good Life

Decades after he set booby traps for the Wet Bandits, **Macaulay Culkin** remains a pop culture icon—and a very wealthy one. As of late 2025, his financial standing is as solid as ever.

## The Number
Estimates peg Culkin's net worth between **$18 million and $25 million**.

## Where Did It Come From?
*   **The 90s Gold Rush**: Culkin was the highest-paid child actor in history. He earned $4.5 million for *Home Alone 2* alone—a staggering sum for 1992.
*   **Royalties**: *Home Alone* is a perennial Christmas classic. While exact residuals are private, the film generates millions annually in licensing and streaming fees.

## Current Ventures
Culkin isn't just resting on his laurels.
*   **Bunny Ears**: His lifestyle brand and podcast network have carved out a niche in the comedy space.
*   **Acting Return**: Recent roles in *American Horror Story* and *The Righteous Gemstones* have reintroduced him to a new generation of fans.

He might not be "Kevin McCallister" anymore, but he is certainly doing just fine.
