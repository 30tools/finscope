# Snoop Dogg Brings the Holiday Heat to Netflix's NFL Halftime

Netflix continued its push into live sports with a star-studded **Christmas Halftime Show** headlined by none other than **Snoop Dogg**. Broadcasting live from U.S. Bank Stadium during the Vikings vs. Lions game, the "Snoop's Holiday Halftime Party" was a viral sensation.

## The Highlights
Snoop, decked out in a festive red suit that instantly became a meme, delivered a performance that blended his West Coast classics with holiday cheer.

### Special Guests
The show wasn't a solo act. Snoop brought out an eclectic mix of friends:
*   **Lainey Wilson**: The country superstar joined Snoop for a soulful rendition of specific holiday tracks.
*   **Andrea & Matteo Bocelli**: In a surprising twist, the opera legend and his son performed "White Christmas," adding a touch of class to the hip-hop party.
*   **Martha Stewart**: Of course, Snoop's best friend made an appearance, continuing their iconic duo legacy.
*   **George Clinton**: The funk legend brought the groove to Minnesota.

## Netflix & The NFL
This marked the second year Netflix has hosted the Christmas Day games, solidifying the streaming giant's place in the sports world. Following Beyoncé’s 2024 performance, Snoop had big shoes to fill—and he did it with his signature laid-back style.

## Fan Reactions
Social media praised the unique mix of genres. From country to opera to G-Funk, the setlist had something for every generation gathered around the TV on Christmas.
