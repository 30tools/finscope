Most people never negotiate their salary. Over a 20–30 year career, that mistake can cost **₹50L–₹2Cr+**.

Negotiation is uncomfortable, but it’s a skill. Here’s a simple framework.

## Step 1: Research Your Market Value

Use:

- Glassdoor
- Levels.fyi (for tech)
- LinkedIn salary insights
- Local job listings in your domain

Look for **title + location/remote**:

> “Software Engineer 2 Bangalore salary range”

Try to identify:

- Median salary
- Top 25% salary
- Your current pay vs this range

If you’re below median and performing well, you have a strong case.

---

## Step 2: Document Your Impact

Your manager doesn’t remember everything you did.

Create a **brag sheet**:

- Features shipped, bugs fixed
- Revenue generated / cost saved
- Performance metrics improved
- Ownership / leadership shown
- Mentoring and extra responsibilities

Example bullets:

- “Improved page load by 40%, reducing bounce rate by 15%”
- “Automated X process, saving 20 hours/month for the team”
- “Led 3-person sub-team to deliver Y project before deadline”

This becomes your **evidence**.

---

## Step 3: Choose Timing Strategically

Good times:

- Just after completing a major project
- During/just before performance review cycle
- After strong performance feedback
- When you’ve taken on significantly more responsibility

Bad times:

- Right after company layoffs
- When team/company is missing targets
- During crisis periods

You want the company in a **neutral or positive** mood.

## Step 4: Ask for the Conversation

Send a simple mail/slack:

> “Hey [Manager], could we schedule 20–30 minutes this week to discuss my role and compensation for the upcoming year?”

This signals seriousness without sounding aggressive.

---

## Step 5: Use the Script

### Opening

> “Thanks for taking the time. I’ve really enjoyed [specific things about team/work]. Over the last [X] months I’ve [impact list]. Based on this and market data for similar roles, I’d like to discuss aligning my compensation.”

Then present your **number**.

> “For someone in this role and level, with my contributions, a compensation in the range of ₹[target] seems appropriate. I’d like to move toward ₹[your number].”

Your number should be:

- Backed by market research
- Slightly above your minimum acceptable
- Reasonable (not 2x current)

---

## Step 6: Handle Objections

Common responses and replies:

**1. “We don’t have budget right now”**

> “I understand. Is there a realistic timeline when we could revisit this? What specific goals would I need to hit by [3–6 months] to justify that compensation?”

**2. “You’re already paid competitively”**

> “Based on my research, similar roles at [companies] are in the ₹X–₹Y range. Given my contributions (A, B, C), I believe I’m closer to that level of impact. How do you see it?”

**3. “We’ll see at appraisal”**

> “Got it. What range should I realistically expect if I continue performing at this level? It helps me plan.”

## Step 7: Think Beyond Base Salary

If base can’t move much, negotiate:

- One-time bonus
- Stock/ESOPs
- Extra leave
- Training/conference budget
- Title upgrade (helps with future jumps)
- More flexible schedule/remote days

Sometimes **title + experience** = bigger future jumps, even if current raise is modest.

---

## Step 8: Have a Plan B (External Offers)

The strongest leverage: a real external offer.

> “I value my work here and would prefer to stay, but I have an offer from [company] at ₹[X]. If we can get closer to that, I’d be happy to continue growing here.”

Important:

- Don’t bluff; only say this if the offer is real.
- Be prepared to leave if they can’t match and you are underpaid.

---

## Key Takeaway

- Research your market value
- Document your impact
- Ask at the right time
- Use calm, confident scripts
- Be flexible on structure (bonus, perks)
- Repeat every 12–18 months

Even a **single 20% jump** early in your career changes your entire wealth trajectory.
