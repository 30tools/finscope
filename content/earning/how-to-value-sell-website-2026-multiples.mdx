# Valuation Guide 2026: What is Your Website Worth?

Digital Real Estate is booming. In 2026, "boring" content sites and SaaS tools are trading at record volumes. But unlike selling a house, pricing a website is an art.

If you list your site for 20x monthly [earning](https://unstory.app/earning)s when the market is paying 45x, you are lighting money on fire.

This guide reveals the **2026 Valuation Multiples** and the exact formula to calculate your exit price.

## The Golden Formula: SDE

Small online [business](https://unstory.app/business)es are valued on **SDE (Seller Discretionary Earnings)**.
**SDE = Net Profit + Add-Backs (Owner Salary + One-time expenses).**

**Valuation = SDE (Monthly) x Multiple.**

### 2026 Multiples by Business Type

| Business Model | Monthly Multiple (x) | Annual Multiple (x) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Content Site (AdSense/Affiliate)** | **32x - 45x** | 2.5x - 3.8x |
| **E-Commerce (Dropshipping)** | **20x - 30x** | 1.6x - 2.5x |
| **E-Commerce (Private Label)** | **30x - 40x** | 2.5x - 3.3x |
| **SaaS (Micro)** | **40x - 60x** | 3.3x - 5.0x |
| **[News](https://unstory.app/news)letter (Substack)** | **25x - 35x** | 2.0x - 3.0x |

*   *Example:* Your finance blog makes $2,000/mo profit.
*   *Valuation:* $2,000 x 36 = **$72,000**.

## What Increases Your Multiple? (The "4 Pillars")

Buyers in 2026 are risk-averse. They pay premiums for:
1.  **Age:** 3+ years of history = Higher Multiple.
2.  **Traffic Diversity:** If 100% of traffic is from Google, you are risky (one algorithm update kills you). If you have Email + Social + Direct traffic, you get a **40x+** multiple.
3.  **Trend Stability:** Is the niche evergreen (e.g., "Camping") or a fad (e.g., "Fidget Spinners")?
4.  **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures):** Can the new owner run it in 1 hour a week? Passive = Premium.

## Verdict

In 2026, the market rewards **Profitability** over Growth.
*   **2021 [Mindset](https://unstory.app/mindset):** "We have 0 profit but growing 100%!" -> Sold for millions.
*   **2026 [Mindset](https://unstory.app/mindset):** "We make $10k profit reliably." -> Sold for $400k.

If you are planning an exit, spend the next 6 months cutting costs and documenting your processes. That is how you turn a 30x multiple into a 45x multiple.
