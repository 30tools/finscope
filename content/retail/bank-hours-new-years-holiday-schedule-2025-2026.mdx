Before you ring in 2026, make sure your finances are in order. Here is the banking schedule for the holiday transition.

## New Year's Eve (Wednesday, Dec 31, 2025)
*   **Status**: **OPEN**
*   **Notes**: Most major banks (Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo) will be open. However, branches may close early (typically 2:00 PM or 3:00 PM) so staff can travel home.

*   **Status**: **CLOSED**
*   **Notes**: This is a Federal Reserve holiday. No branches will be open, and transactions processed on this day will not post until Friday, Jan 2.
