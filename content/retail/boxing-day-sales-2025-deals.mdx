# Boxing Day 2025: Your Guide to the Best Post-Holiday Sales

Christmas is over, but the shopping season has one final sprint. **Boxing Day (December 26)** kicks off the year-end clearance events where retailers try to offload unsold holiday inventory before 2026. This is often the *best* time of year to buy winter coats, electronics, and home goods.

## Top Sales to Watch

### 1. Lululemon "We Made Too Much"
Lululemon's end-of-year event is legendary.
*   **The Deal**: Massive markdowns on leggings, sports bras, and outerwear.
*   **Why**: Lululemon is facing inventory pressure and has launched significant discounts to clear stock.
*   **Best Buy**: Look for Align leggings and winter puffers.

### 2. Amazon Year-End Deals
*   **The Deal**: Up to 50% off tech and home appliances.
*   **Best Buy**: Smart home devices (Echo, Ring), air fryers, and 2025 calendars/planners.

### 3. Fashion & Accessories
*   **Coach Outlet**: offering an extra 20% off already discounted bags.
*   **Nordstrom**: The "Half-Yearly Sale" is live, with designer items up to 60% off.
*   **Zara**: Their famous winter sale usually starts on Boxing Day online.

## Strategy for Shoppers
1.  **Online is Better**: Avoid the chaotic malls. Most of these deals are available (and often better) online.
2.  **Focus on "Winter" Items**: Retailers are desperate to clear space for Spring collections. Coats, boots, and sweaters will see the deepest cuts.
3.  **Check Return Policies**: "Final Sale" items at places like Lululemon cannot be returned. Be sure of your size before clicking buy.

Happy hunting!
