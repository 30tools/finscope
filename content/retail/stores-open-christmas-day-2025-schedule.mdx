# Emergency Shopping: What Stores Are Open on Christmas Day 2025?

It happens to the best of us: the batteries are missing, the milk is spoiled, or you forgot a gift for Uncle Bob. While major retailers close their doors to let employees celebrate, a few lifesavers remain open on December 25th.

## Pharmacies & Convenience

Your best bet for last-minute essentials.

*   **CVS**: **OPEN**. Most locations operate with reduced hours (typically 8 AM – 9 PM).
*   **Walgreens**: **OPEN**. Many non-24-hour stores will be open from 9 AM – 5 PM. 24-hour locations remain open all day.
*   **7-Eleven**: **OPEN**. Reliable as always, most locations are open 24/7.
*   **Wawa / Sheetz**: **OPEN**. If you are in the Mid-Atlantic, these are your best friends for food and gas.

## Grocery Stores

Finding a full grocery store is tough. Most are closed.
*   **OPEN (Select Locations)**: Albertsons, Safeway, and Giant Food often have limited holiday hours (e.g., 8 AM – 4 PM). Call ahead!
*   **CLOSED**: Walmart, Target, Publix, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Aldi, and Costco are **CLOSED** nationwide.

## Retail Experts
*   **Family Dollar / Dollar General**: **Mixed**. Some locations open for short shifts, but don't count on it without checking the app.

## Tips for Christmas Day Shopping
1.  **Call Ahead**: This cannot be stressed enough. "Open" on Google Maps does not always mean open on Christmas.
2.  **Go Early**: Most stores that do open will close early (around 4 PM or 5 PM).
3.  **Be Patient**: Staffing is minimal. The lines will be long.

Good luck saving Christmas!
