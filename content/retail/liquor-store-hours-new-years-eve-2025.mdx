# Buying Champagne for NYE? Check the Clock

Liquor laws vary wildly by state, which can make New Year's Eve shopping tricky. Here is a general guide for **December 31, 2025**.

## Private Liquor Stores (CA, NY, FL, TX, IL)
*   **Status**: **OPEN**
*   **Hours**: Most will stay open late (until 10:00 PM or 11:00 PM) to capture last-minute sales.
*   **Warning**: In Texas, liquor stores must close by 9:00 PM.

## Control States (PA, NC, VA, NH)
*   **Status**: **OPEN** (State-run stores)
*   **Hours**: State-run ABC stores typically close earlier, often at **6:00 PM or 7:00 PM**. Do not wait until the last minute.

## New Year's Day Rules
*   **Most States**: Buying alcohol is legal on Jan 1.
*   **Restrictions**: Some local counties (especially in the South) may have "blue laws" restricting alcohol sales on holidays.
