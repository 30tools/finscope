## The Case for the Preferred ($95)

For most beginners, the **CSP** is the winner.
1.  **Low Risk**: The $95 fee is negligible compared to the value of the 60,000 bonus points (worth ~$750).
2.  **Great Transfer Partners**: You can transfer points 1:1 to Hyatt, United, and British Airways.
3.  **Solid Insurance**: Primary rental car insurance coverage is included.

## The Case for the Reserve ($550)

The **CSR** is for the frequent flyer.
1.  **Effective Fee is $250**: The $300 travel credit applies automatically to *any* travel (Uber, flights, subway), effectively bringing the fee down to $250.
2.  **Lounge Access**: Access to Priority Pass lounges and the exclusive **Chase Sapphire Lounges** (which are stunning).
3.  **50% Boost**: Points are worth 50% more when booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards.

> **Verdict**: If you visit an airport lounge more than 3 times a year, get the **Reserve**. Otherwise, stick to the **Preferred**.
