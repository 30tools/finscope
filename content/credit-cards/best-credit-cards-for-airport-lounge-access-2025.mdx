# Best Credit Cards for Airport Lounge Access in India (2025)

Traveling can be stressful, but airport lounges make it bearable. Free food, comfortable seating, and cleaner wify—who doesn't want that?

However, in late 2025, most banks (Axis, ICICI, SBI) introduced **spend-based criteria** for lounge access. You now often need to spend ₹35,000–₹50,000 per quarter just to enter.

But don't worry. There are still cards that offer **unconditional, unlimited** access. Here are the winners.

## Top Picks for Unlimited Access

| Card Name | Fee | Domestic Lounges | International Lounges | Guest Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HDFC Infinia Metal** | ₹12,500 | Unlimited | Unlimited (Priority Pass) | Yes (Unlimited) |
| **Axis Reserve** | ₹50,000 | Unlimited | Unlimited (Priority Pass) | Yes (4/year) |
| **SBI Aurum** | ₹10,000 | Unlimited | Unlimited (DreamFolks) | No |
| **Marriott Bonvoy HDFC** | ₹3,000 | 12/year | 12/year | No |

## 1. HDFC Infinia Metal Edition

**The Undisputed King.**

Even in 2025, the HDFC Infinia stands tall. It is one of the few cards that allows **unlimited lounge access for both the primary and add-on cardholders**.

*   **Why it wins:** You can issue add-on cards for your parents or spouse, and they all get their own Priority Pass.
*   **Reward Rate:** 3.3% flat (up to 33% on SmartBuy).

## 2. Axis Bank Reserve

**The Ultra-Premium Choice.**

While Axis devalued the Magnus, the Reserve retains its luxury perks. It offers unlimited lounge visits and, crucially, **4 free guest visits** per year—perfect for family trips.

*   **Perk:** Luxury airport transfer services (4/year).
*   **Cost:** Steep ₹50,000 annual fee.

## 3. Best Mid-Range Option: HDFC Regalia Gold

If you can't afford the super-premium cards, the **Regalia Gold** is the "sweet spot".

*   **Access:** 12 Domestic + 6 International (via Priority Pass).
*   **Condition:** Unconditional. No "spend last quarter" nonsense.
*   **Fee:** ₹2,500 (Waivable).

## 4. The "Budget" Warrior: IXIGO AU Credit Card

For a lifetime free (LTF) or low-fee card, the **IXIGO AU Bank** card is a surprise contender.

*   **Access:** 16 Domestic visits (International + Domestic mixed).
*   **Fee:** Often issued Lifetime Free.
*   **Zero Forex:** Yes, it has 0% forex markup too!

## Why Not Scapia or Niyo?

Cards like Scapia used to be great, but they now have strict daily/monthly spend limits to unlock the lounge section in their app. They are no longer reliable for frequent flyers.

## Conclusion

In 2025, "free" lounge access is no longer truly free unless you pay a premium annual fee. 

*   **Money no object?** Get HDFC Infinia.
*   **Mid-range traveler?** HDFC Regalia Gold or Amex Platinum Travel.
*   **Budget?** AU IXIGO or IDFC First Wealth (if eligible).

## FAQs

### 1. Does usage of Priority Pass in India charge money?
On most HDFC cards (Infinia/Regalia), using Priority Pass within India charges a fee (~$27). Always use your Credit Card directly for domestic lounges and Priority Pass only for international ones.

### 2. Can I use my lounge access for my friend?
Only if your card explicitly supports "Guest Access" (like Axis Reserve or Amex Platinum Charge). Otherwise, you will be charged.
