# Solar Maximum 2026: Risks to the Internet and GPS

**Boulder, CO, Jan 3, 2026:** The Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis) were seen in Texas last year. Beautiful? Yes. A warning sign? Definitely.

We are currently in **Solar Cycle 25**, and 2026 marks the predicted peak intensity ("Solar Maximum").

## The "Carrington Event" Scenario
A massive Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) hitting Earth directly could induce currents in long electrical lines.
*   **Risk:** Power grid transformers melting. Undersea internet cables (specifically the repeaters) failing.
*   **Probability:** Low, but non-zero (~10%).

## What to Expect
1.  **GPS Glitches:** Expect flight diversions and agricultural drone errors.
2.  **Radio Blackouts:** Ham radio and HF communications will be spotty.
3.  **Spectacular Auroras:** You will likely see the lights as far south as Italy and California again.

## Preparation
Governments are hardening the grid. Satellite operators (Starlink) are maneuvering units to safe modes. As a civilian? Just enjoy the light show. If the internet goes down globally, you have bigger problems than checking Instagram.
