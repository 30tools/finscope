## Why is Silver Rising?
1.  **Industrial Demand:** 2025 has seen massive demand from the **Solar Panel (PV)** and **EV battery** sectors. China's new export restrictions on industrial silver (effective Jan 1, 2026) have caused panic buying in global markets.
2.  **Weak Rupee:** The Indian Rupee has depreciated against the dollar, making imports more expensive.
3.  **MCX Trends:** On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures for Mar 2026 delivery are trading at a premium, signaling that traders expect prices to go even higher.

## Should You Buy?
Analysts suggest a "Buy on Dips" strategy.
*   **Support Level:** ₹2,45,000 / kg.
*   **Resistance Level:** ₹2,55,000 / kg.

With the wedding season upcoming and industrial demand peaking, silver is expected to test the **₹2.6 Lakh** mark by mid-January 2026.
