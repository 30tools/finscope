## Is Sadie Sink in Season 5?
**Yes.** Sadie Sink returns as Max, but her role is different from previous seasons.
For most of Volume 1, Max remains comatose in the hospital. However, her consciousness is not gone—it's trapped.

## The Mental Battleground
In **Episode 6 (Escape from Camazotz)**, Eleven enters Max's mind (The Void) to find her.
*   **The State of Max:** She is physically blind and broken, wandering a "psychic construct" created by Vecna.
*   **The Twist:** Max isn't just a victim; she's a vessel. Vecna is using her to spy on the group.

## Will She Wake Up?
As of the end of **Volume 2**, Max has **not woken up** physically. The Series Finale ("The Rightside Up") will likely center largely on the battle for her soul. If Eleven defeats Vecna, theory holds that Max's mind will return to her body.

**Sadie Sink's Performance:** Critics are calling her voice-acting and "void" scenes some of the most haunting work of the series.
