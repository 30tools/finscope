## The Short Answer: Yes
**Most Starbucks locations will be open** on January 1, 2026.

## The Details
*   **Modified Hours:** Unlike a regular weekday, don't expect your local shop to open at 5 AM. Most stores will operate on a "holiday schedule," typically opening between **7:00 AM and 9:00 AM**.
*   **Closing:** Many will also close earlier than usual, often by **6:00 PM or 8:00 PM**.
*   **Mobile Order:** The app is the best way to check. If a store is closed or has modified hours, the app will reflect this in real-time.

## Menu Updates
January 1st usually marks the end of the "Holiday Menu" (Peppermint Mocha) and the soft launch of the **Winter Menu** (Pistachio Latte is rumored to return).

**Recommendation:** Go after 9 AM to be safe and avoid the "morning after" rush.
