## The Leaders of the Pack
Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest masterpiece, **"One Battle After Another,"** leads the film categories with a staggering nine nominations. In a historic feat, it became the sixth film in Globe history to land five acting nods across all four primary categories.

In Television, **"The White Lotus"** continues its dominance with six nominations for its third season, followed closely by the gritty drama **"Adolescence"** with five.

## Major Motion Picture Nominations

### Best Motion Picture – Drama
*   *Frankenstein* (Netflix)
*   *Hamnet* (Focus Features)
*   *It Was Just an Accident* (NEON)
*   *The Secret Agent* (NEON)
*   *Sentimental Value* (NEON)
*   *Sinners* (Warner Bros. Pictures)

### Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy
*   *Blue Moon* (Sony Pictures Classics)
*   *Bugonia* (Focus Features)
*   *Marty Supreme* (A24)
*   *No Other Choice* (NEON)
*   *Nouvelle Vague* (Netflix)
*   *One Battle After Another* (Warner Bros. Pictures)

## Acting Highlights

### Best Performance by a Male Actor – Drama
The race is incredibly tight, featuring heavyweights like **Oscar Isaac** for *Frankenstein* and **Michael B. Jordan** for *Sinners*. A major surprise was **Jeremy Allen White**'s nomination for the Springsteen biopic *Deliver Me from Nowhere*, proving his transition to film is as successful as his TV stint.

### Best Performance by a Female Actor – Musical or Comedy
**Cynthia Erivo** (*Wicked: For Good*) and **Emma Stone** (*Bugonia*) are the frontrunners here, though newcomer **Chase Infiniti** for *One Battle After Another* is being hailed as the year's breakout star.

## Notable Snubs
Despite the broad list, some fan favorites were left in the cold:
*   **Ridley Scott’s Epic:** Many expected *Gladiator III* (if released in 2025) to make a splash, but it was conspicuously absent from major categories.
*   **The Bear Season 4:** While Jeremy Allen White succeeded in film, *The Bear*'s latest season saw fewer nominations than its predecessors, missing out on Best Supporting Actress.

## The New Categories
2026 marks the first year the Golden Globes have introduced a **"Best Podcast"** category, acknowledging the medium's massive cultural impact. The inclusion of *The Daily* and *SmartLess* in the inaugural lineup signals a modern shift for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
