## A Life in Two Acts
Bardot died peacefully at her home, *La Madrague*, in Saint-Tropez.

### The Screen Siren
Bursting onto the scene in the 1956 film *And God Created Woman*, Bardot became an international sex symbol and the face of French New Wave cinema. She retired from acting in 1973, at the height of her fame, leaving behind a legacy of over 40 films.

### The crusader
In her second act, she became a fierce advocate for animal rights. She founded the **Brigitte Bardot Foundation** in 1986, campaigning against fur, seal hunting, and animal cruelty. Even in her final months, she remained active, vowing to "go to war" against hunting practices.

## Tributes Pour In
*   **President Emmanuel Macron:** "[France](https://unstory.app/trending/france-social-media-ban-under-15-explained) mourns a legend who embodied a life of freedom."
*   **Brigitte Bardot Foundation:** "We have lost our mother, our inspiration."

Her legacy lives on not just in film, but in the thousands of animals her foundation continues to protect.
