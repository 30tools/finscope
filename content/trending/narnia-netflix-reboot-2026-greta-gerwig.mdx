# Netflix's Narnia Reboot (2026): Everything We Know So Far

**Jan 3, 2026:** It has been years since Netflix bought the rights to C.S. Lewis's entire bibliography. Now, the Lion is ready to roar.

Director **Greta Gerwig** is helming the project, and 2026 is the year we finally see Narnia again.

## The Director's Vision
Gerwig has stated she wants to capture the "dream-like quality" of the books. Unlike the gritty 2000s movies, expect something more whimsical, practical, and magical.

## Which Book First?
Netflix is starting chronologically with **"The Magician's Nephew"** (the origin story of Narnia), not "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe."
*   **Plot:** Digory and Polly discover the wood between the worlds and witness Aslan singing Narnia into existence.

## Release Strategy
Insiders report a **Christmas 2026** global release, with a potential limited IMAX theatrical run in November to qualify for Oscars.

## Why It Matters
This is Netflix's attempt to build a "Star Wars" level franchise. If it works, we will be in Narnia for the next decade.
