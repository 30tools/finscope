# Nancy, Jonathan, and Steve: The Final Love Triangle Verdict

**Dec 29, 2025:** Amidst the apocalypse in Hawkins, relationship drama still manages to take center stage. The question on every fan's mind after Volume 2: **Are Nancy and Jonathan still together?**

<AdSlot type="display" />

## The Status Quo (Spoilers Ahead)
As of **Volume 2**, Nancy and Jonathan are **[tech](https://unstory.app/tech)nically still together**, but the cracks are undeniable.
*   **The Distance:** College dreams pulled them apart in Season 4, and the war for Hawkins hasn't brought them much closer emotionally.
*   **The Steve Factor:** Steve Harrington has matured into a hero/babysitter extraordinaire. His chemistry with Nancy in **Episode 5 (Shock Jock)** was palpable, reigniting the "Stancy" flame.

### Key Moments in Season 5
1.  **The Hospital Scene:** Jonathan admits he feels "stuck" while Nancy has big ambitions.
2.  **The RV Talk:** Steve confesses he envisions a future with Nancy (again).

## Prediction for the Finale
With only one episode left ("The Rightside Up"), theories suggest Nancy might choose **neither**. The 80s heroine archetype often ends up prioritizing her [career](https://unstory.app/career)/survival over a high school romance. However, if she does pick a side, momentum is swinging dangerously toward Steve.

**Verdict:** Complicated. Very complicated.
