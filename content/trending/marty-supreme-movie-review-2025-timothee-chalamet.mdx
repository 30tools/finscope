## The Plot
Loosely based on true events, the film follows **Marty Reisman** (Chalamet), a hustler and ping-pong wizard who navigates the underground gambling dens of NYC. It’s not just about sports; it’s about obsession, ego, and the cost of being "Supreme."

## The Cast
*   **Timothée Chalamet:** Transforms into the eccentric, mustache-wielding Reisman. Critics call it "his most electric performance yet."
*   **Gwyneth Paltrow:** Returns to the screen in a pivotal supporting role.
*   **Tyler, The Creator:** Makes a surprising and charismatic acting debut.

## Safdie's Direction
In his first solo directorial effort since splitting with brother Benny, Josh Safdie maintains the frantic, anxiety-inducing energy he is famous for. The ping-pong matches are filmed like gladiator battles—intense, sweaty, and visceral.

## Verdict
**4/5 Stars.** *Marty Supreme* is a niche biopic that plays like a thriller. It’s loud, fast, and undeniably entertaining.
