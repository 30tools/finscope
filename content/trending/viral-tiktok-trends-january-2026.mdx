## 1. The "Final Boss" Trend
*   **The Sound:** An orchestral remix of a 90s video game track (Final Fantasy or Dark Souls).
*   **The Content:** Creators showing their "Final Form."
    *   *Examples:* Dressing up for a corporate presentation, hitting a PR in the gym, or an artist revealing a finished masterpiece.
    *   *Message:* "I have ascended."

## 2. "Why Did You?" (The Callout)
*   **The Vibe:** Vulnerable confusion.
*   **The Content:** Looking at the camera with text overlays asking their younger selves baffling questions.
    *   "Why did you think cutting your own bangs was a move?"
    *   "Why did you date that guy who lived in a van?"

## 3. "Things I Regret This Year" (Optimization Culture)
A twist on resolutions. Instead of goals, people are listing things they stand by *stopping*.
*   "I regret saying yes to events I hated."
*   "I regret not quitting sooner."

## 4. "Episode Content"
