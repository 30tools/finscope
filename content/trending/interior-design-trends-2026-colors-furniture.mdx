# Interior Design 2026: Warm Colors & The End of Gray

**Milan, Jan 3, 2026:** Look at your walls. Are they "Agreeable Gray"? If so, we have bad news.

The "Flippers Gray" aesthetic is dead. 2026 is the year of **Personality** and **Warmth**.

## 1. Color Palette: Earth & Spice
*   **In:** Terracotta, Olive Green, Espresso Brown, Butter Yellow.
*   **Out:** Cool Gray, Stark White, "Pop of Color" (Primary Blue/Red).
*   **Why:** After years of digital overstimulation, we crave homes that feel like "hugs."

## 2. Furniture: Curves & Comfort
The sharp, mid-century modern lines are softening.
*   **The Look:** "Chubby" sofas. Bouclé fabric (still here!). Rounded coffee tables.
*   **Rule:** If you can't nap on it, don't buy it.

## 3. Dark Wood Renaissance
Blonde Scandinavian wood is taking a backseat to **Walnut** and **Mahogany**. Darker woods ground a room and feel more expensive/historic.

## 4. "Dopamine Decor"
Thrifting is king. A weird ceramic cat from 1980 is better than a mass-produced vase from Target. Your home should look like *you*, not a showroom.

## Verdict
Paint the ceiling. Buy the velvet couch. 2026 is about bravery.
