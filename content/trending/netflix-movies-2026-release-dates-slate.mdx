Greta Gerwig (Barbie) directs the first entry in Netflix's massive Narnia reboot.
*   **The Hype:** It's being called "This generation's Harry Potter."
*   **The Scale:** A reported $250M budget.

### 2. Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man (Summer 2026)
Thomas Shelby returns. Cillian Murphy stars in the feature-length conclusion to the BBC/Netflix saga, set during WWII.

### 3. The Rip (Jan 16, 2026)
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon reunite for a gritty crime thriller about cops stealing drug money.

## Animated & Family
*   **Steps:** A twist on Cinderella produced by Amy Poehler.
