## The Big Stars of 2026

### 1. Betty Boop
The iconic flapper cartoon character (specifically her early 1930 iteration) is now free. Expect to see her in:
*   Horror movies (The "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey" effect).
*   Indie video games.
*   Streetwear brands.

### 2. Nancy Drew
The first three books in the Nancy Drew series (*The Secret of the Old Clock*, etc.) are public domain. Note: Later versions of the character are still protected, but the 1930 version is fair game.

### 3. The Maltese Falcon
Dashiell Hammett's iconic detective novel is free. Noir filmmakers, start your engines.

## What This Means for Creators
You can now:
*   Remix these characters into your own stories.
*   Publish and sell the original books yourself.
*   Create merchandise.

**Warning:** Trademark law is separate from Copyright. You can use the *character* Betty Boop, but you might get sued if you use the *logo* in a way that confuses consumers. Always consult a lawyer for commercial projects.
