# Key Person Insurance 2026: The "Bus Factor" Policy

Founders hate talking about death. Startups run on optimism.
But investors run on risk management.

If your CTO (who wrote all the code) gets hit by a bus tomorrow, does the company fold?
**Key Person Insurance** is a life insurance policy taken out by the *company* on a *crucial employee*. The company pays the premiums, and the company gets the death benefit.

In 2026, Venture Capital (VC) firms almost universally mandate this for Series A funding.

## How It Works

1.  **The Insured:** The CEO, Top Salesperson, or Lead Engineer.
2.  **The Beneficiary:** The Company (LLC or Inc).
3.  **The Use of Funds:** If the Key Person dies, the company gets ~$1M - $5M cash. This pays for:
    *   Hiring a specialized recruiter to find a replacement.
    *   Paying off business loans that the founder personally guaranteed.
    *   Buying out the deceased founder's shares from their spouse.

## Cost in 2026

It is surprisingly cheap because it is usually **Term Life Insurance**.
*   **Scenario:** 35-year-old Male CEO, Non-Smoker, Good Health.
*   **Policy:** $1 Million / 20-Year Term.
*   **Cost:** **~$700 - $1,000 per year.**

*Compare that to the risk of the company collapsing.*

## Is It Tax Deductible?

**Generally, NO.**
*   **Premiums:** Not tax-deductible expenses for the business.
*   **Payout:** **Tax-Free** income for the business.
*   *This is usually the preferred structure.* You pay tax on the small premium so you get the big million-dollar check tax-free.

## Who Needs It?

1.  ** VC-Backed Startups:** Mandatory.
2.  **Small Partnerships:** If you own a business 50/50 with a partner, buy **Cross-Purchase Key Person policies**. If Partner A dies, Partner B uses the insurance money to buy Partner A's shares from their family. Without this, you might end up in business with your partner's husband/wife (who knows nothing about the business).

## Verdict
For &lt;$100/month, Key Person insurance is the cheapest way to ensure your business legacy survives your own mortality. If you have investors or business debt, get it today.
