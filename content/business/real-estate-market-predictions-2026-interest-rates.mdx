# Real Estate 2026 Forecast: Will Interest Rates Finally Drop?

## Mortgage Rates: The Magic Number 5%
The Federal Reserve has signaled stabilization. Experts predict 30-year fixed rates will settle around **5.5% - 5.8%** by mid-2026.
*   This isn't the 3% of 2021 (that is gone forever).
*   But it is low enough to unlock the "Golden Handcuff" effect, encouraging existing homeowners to finally sell.

## Inventory Surge
As rates dip, millions of homes held by boomers and Gen X will hit the market.
*   **Result:** More choices for buyers, but steady prices. Do not expect a crash. The supply shortage is still essentially structural (we didn't build enough homes for 10 years).

## Best Markets to Buy in 2026
1.  **Midwest:** Columbus, Indianapolis. (Affordable, climate resilient).
2.  **The "New" South:** Huntsville, AL and Greenville, SC. (Tech jobs, low taxes).

## Verdict
If you have been waiting on the sidelines, 2026 is your year. The bidding wars are cooler, and the rates are manageable. Date the rate, marry the house.
