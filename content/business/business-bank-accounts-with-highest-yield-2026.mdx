## Why "Big Banks" Are Failing You
In 2026, Chase and Bank of America rely on "Interests Rate Inertia." They know most business owners are too busy to switch banks. They keep your rates at 0.01% because they know you probably won't leave for an extra 5%.

**Don't fall for it.**
Switching to **Mercury** or **Bluevine** takes 20 minutes and generates a "Risk-Free" return that is higher than the stock market average.

## Verdict
*   If you have **$250k+**, go with **Mercury Treasury**. The yield and professional tooling are unmatched.
*   If you have **$50k - $200k**, go with **Bluevine**. It combines high yield with traditional [banking](https://unstory.app/banking) features.
*   If you have **&lt;$50k**, go with **Relay**. The ability to organize your cash is more valuable than the interest at this level.
