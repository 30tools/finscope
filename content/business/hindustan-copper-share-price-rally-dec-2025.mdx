## Why is it Rallying?

### 1. Global Copper Shortage
Copper futures on the London Metal Exchange (LME) touched $11,000/tonne this week. With the EV revolution and AI data centers requiring massive amounts of copper wire, demand has outstripped supply. As India's only vertically integrated copper producer, HCL is the prime beneficiary.

### 2. China's Export Ban
China has announced restrictions on copper exports starting **Jan 1, 2026**. This has created a supply shock, forcing global buyers to look for alternative contract manufacturers. HCL is perfectly positioned to fill this gap.

### 3. Rupee Depreciation
The Indian Rupee has slipped to 84.5 against the USD. Since copper pricing is dollar-linked, HCL's realizations (margins) have improved significantly.

## Technical Analysis
*   **Current Price:** ₹545.95
*   **RSI:** 81 (Overbought Zone).
*   **Support:** ₹450
*   **Target (Q1 2026):** ₹620

## Brokerage View
Most domestic brokerages have upgraded the stock to **"BUY"**.
> "Hindustan Copper is playing on a multi-year supercycle. The expansion of the Malanjkhand mine will double their capacity by 2027. Any dip towards ₹480 is a buying opportunity." — *Ventura Securities*

**Verdict:** If you hold it, trail your stop loss to ₹500. If you are new, wait for a cool-off before entering.
