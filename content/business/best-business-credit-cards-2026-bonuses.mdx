## 1. The Heavyweight: Amex Business Platinum
**Best For:** Luxury Travel & Advertising Spend.
*   **Welcome Offer:** **200,000 Membership Rewards points** after $20k spend.
*   **Annual Fee:** $695.
*   **The Math:** Those 200k points are worth ~$4,000 when transferred to airlines. Even with the high fee, you come out **$3,300+ ahead** in Year 1.
*   **Verdict:** Essential if you spend $50k+ a year on Facebook Ads or Google Ads (1.5x points on large purchases).

## 2. The Value King: Chase Ink Business Preferred
**Best For:** Shipping, Travel, and Ad Agencies.
*   **Welcome Offer:** **100,000 Ultimate Rewards points** after $8k spend.
*   **Annual Fee:** $95.
*   **The Perks:** 3x points on the first $150,000 spent on travel, shipping, and internet/cable services.
*   **Verdict:** The best "all-rounder." Points are easy to use and transferrable to Hyatt (the best value hotel partner in 2026).

## 3. The Simple Choice: Capital One Venture X Business
**Best For:** Flat-rate rewards without the "category" headache.
*   **Welcome Offer:** **Up to 400,000 Miles** (Requires high spend—often $150k over 6 months).
*   **Annual Fee:** $395.
*   **The Math:** 2x miles on every single purchase. No categories. No caps. 
*   **Verdict:** If your business spending is random and doesn't fit into "office supplies" or "travel," this is the card for you.

## Three Tips for 2026 Card Strategy

1.  **The "Business/Personal" Separation:** Never put personal expenses on these cards. In 2026, the IRS is using AI to scan credit card statements for non-business deductions. Keep it clean.
2.  **Player 2 Mode:** If you have a business partner, you can both get the same card and refer each other for an extra 20,000 - 40,000 "Referral Bonus."
3.  **The 5/24 Rule:** Remember that Chase will likely decline you if you have opened more than 5 personal credit cards in the last 24 months.

## Verdict
If you have a big tax bill or inventory purchase coming up, open the **Amex Business Platinum**. If you just want a reliable card with a low fee, the **Chase Ink Preferred** is the 2026 gold standard.
