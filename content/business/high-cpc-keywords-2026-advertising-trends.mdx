## The Top 5 High-CPC Niches in 2026

*   *Keywords:* `enterprise rag implementation`, `agentic ai platforms`, `ai compliance software`, `automated workflow orchestration`.

### 2. Cybersecurity & Zero Trust ($60 - $120 CPC)
With the rise of deepfake fraud, security is the #1 spend for CTOs.
*   *Keywords:* `zero trust architecture vendors`, `deepfake detection software`, `quantum resilience services`, `sase security providers`.

### 3. Specialized Insurance ($50 - $100 CPC)

*   *Keywords:* `cyber liability insurance quotes`, `directors and officers insurance`, `commercial drone insurance`, `crypto custody insurance`.

### 4. B2B Fintech & Lending ($40 - $90 CPC)
Banks are fighting for small business clients.
*   *Keywords:* `invoice factoring for saas`, `bad credit business lines of credit`, `merchant cash advance no pg`, `corporate treasure management`.

## How to Capture This Traffic
Don't just stuff keywords. In 2026, Google's **Helpful Content Update (v4)** punishes generic articles. To rank for `enterprise ai platforms`, you need to write a deep, comparative guide with original insights.

**The Strategy:** Focus on "Comparison" and "Alternative" keywords (e.g., "Best Cylance Alternatives 2026"). These have high "Commercial Intent," meaning the reader is ready to buy—and advertisers know it.
