*   **Spot ETFs:** The success of US Spot ETFs continues to drain OTC desks of supply.

## Regulatory Landscape
The defining theme of 2026 will be **MiCA Full Implementation** in Europe and potentially new stablecoin legislation in the US.
*   **DeFi:** Expect stricter KYC requirements for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
*   **Stablecoins:** USD-backed stablecoins will likely face [banking](https://unstory.app/banking)-grade audits.

## Emerging Sectors
*   **RWA (Real World Assets):** Tokenization of bonds and real estate is expected to be the trillions-dollar narrative of 2026.
*   **Gaming:** Web3 gaming ("GameFi") is shifting from "play-to-earn" to "play-and-own," prioritizing fun over finance.

**Advice:** Markets are cyclical. 2026 is positioned as a year of growth, but "Only invest what you can afford to lose" remains the golden rule.
