# PAN-Aadhaar Linking: Do This Before Dec 31, 2025 Or Face Consequences

**New Delhi, Dec 29, 2025:** The Income Tax Department has issued a final reminder: Link your PAN with Aadhaar by **December 31, 2025**, or your PAN will become "Inoperative" starting **January 1, 2026**.

## Who is at Risk?
This deadline specifically applies to frequent defaulters who have ignored previous notifications.
If you fall into the category of individuals who obtained PAN using an old Aadhaar enrollment ID (pre-Oct 2024), this is your **last chance** to link them without facing the severe penalties of the 2026 regime.

## Consequences of "Inoperative PAN" (From Jan 1, 2026)
1.  **No Tax Refunds:** Your ITR refunds will be blocked.
2.  **Higher TDS:** Banks will deduct **20% TDS** on your interest income (instead of the usual 10%).
3.  **Transaction Failures:** You will not be able to invest in Mutual Funds, buy stocks, or purchase a car/property valued over ₹10 Lakhs.
4.  **Salary Stop:** Many employers will be unable to process salaries if the PAN status shows as invalid.

## How to Check Status
1.  Go to the **Income Tax e-Filing Portal**.
2.  Click on "Link Aadhaar Status."
3.  Enter your PAN and Aadhaar Number.
4.  If it says *"PAN is already linked"*, you are safe.

## Is There a Fee?
Yes. For most users linking now, a late fee of **₹1,000** must be paid via challan before submitting the linking request. This fee might increase to **₹5,000** if you miss the Dec 31 deadline.

**Action Item:** Do not wait for the server crash on Dec 31st. Check your status today.
