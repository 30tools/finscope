# Max Brosmer: The Intelligent QB Turning Heads

As we approach the NFL Draft season, one name gaining traction among scouts looking for a late-round steal is **Max Brosmer**. The Minnesota quarterback has built a reputation as one of the smartest signal-callers in college football.

## The Profile
*   **School**: Minnesota (Transfer from New Hampshire)
*   **Position**: Quarterback
*   **Projection**: Late Rounds (6th-7th) / Priority Free Agent

## Strengths
*   **Football IQ**: Brosmer is praised for his ability to process defenses and make the right read. He rarely puts the ball in harm's way.
*   **Experience**: A veteran of college football, he has seen extensive playing time at both the FCS and FBS levels.
*   **Accuracy**: High completion percentage on short-to-intermediate routes.

## Weaknesses
*   **Injury History**: Two major knee injuries (ACL and LCL tears) are red flags for medical teams.
*   **Physical Tools**: He lacks the elite arm strength and mobility of top-tier prospects. He is a pure pocket passer in an era that favors dual-threat QBs.

## The Verdict
Max Brosmer projects as a **high-end backup**. Think along the lines of a Case Keenum or Brian Hoyer—a reliable veteran who can step in, manage the game, and not lose it for you. A strong showing at the Shrine Bowl has helped his stock, moving him from "undrafted" to "draftable" on many boards.
