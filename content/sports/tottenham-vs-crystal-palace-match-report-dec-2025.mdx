## Match Summary

The game was a tense affair, typical of a festive period London derby. Tottenham, looking to bounce back from a rocky start to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign under manager **Thomas Frank**, controlled possession but found it difficult to break down a resilient Palace defense.

### The Decisive Moment
The breakthrough came in the **32nd minute**.
A dangerous cross from **Pedro Porro** found **Archie Gray** ghosting into the box. The young midfielder rose highest to guide a header into the far corner, leaving Eagles goalkeeper **Dean Henderson** with no chance. It was Gray's first Premier League goal of the season.

### Palace's Struggles
For Crystal Palace, this defeat marks their third consecutive loss in the league. Despite the creative efforts of **Eberechi Eze** and the physical presence of **Jean-Philippe Mateta**, Oliver Glasner's side failed to register a single shot on target in the second half.

## Key Performances
*   **Archie Gray (TOT):** Man of the Match. Scored the winner and controlled the midfield tempo.
*   **Micky van de Ven (TOT):** His recovery pace thwarted two clear Palace counter-attacks.
*   **Marc Guéhi (CRY):** Solid at the back despite the loss, winning 100% of his ground duels.

## League Implications
*   **Tottenham:** The win moves Spurs up to **9th** in the table, keeping their hopes of European qualification alive.
*   **Crystal Palace:** They remain in **12th**, but the gap to the relegation zone is narrowing after a poor run of form in December.

**Next Up:** Tottenham hosts Manchester United on New Year's Day, while Palace travels to Brighton for another derby clash.
