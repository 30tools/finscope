# Djokovic at 38: Age is Just a Number in the Pursuit of History

**Dec 29, 2025:** As the tennis world looks toward **Melbourne Park on January 18, 2026**, one name continues to loom larger than all others: **Novak Djokovic**. At 38 years old, the Serbian legend is no longer the undisputed No. 1, but he remains the most dangerous "gatekeeper" in sports history.

## The Status of the GOAT
Djokovic finished 2025 ranked **World No. 4**. While he didn't win a major in 2025 (reaching three semifinals and one final), his consistency at his age is unprecedented. He has chosen a unique path for the 2026 season, entering the **Adelaide International** as a warm-up—a move he hasn't made in years.

## The Magic Number: 25
Djokovic currently shares the all-time record for major titles (24) with Margaret Court. Winning in Melbourne would:
1.  Make him the outright leader in tennis history (men and women).
2.  Extend his record to **11 Australian Open titles**.
3.  Secure his status as the oldest Grand Slam winner in the Open Era.

## The Obstacles
The main challenge isn't his stamina; it's the "Young Guard." Sinner and Alcaraz have developed a game that is physically taxing for a 38-year-old over five sets. However, Djokovic’s tactical brilliance and ability to win "the big points" remains unmatched.
"I don't play for ranking anymore," Djokovic told reporters in Belgrade recently. "I play for the history books."

## Our Verdict
Never count Novak out at the Rod Laver Arena. While he might not be the favorite on paper, he is the only player in the draw who knows how to win 7 matches in Melbourne without breaking a sweat mentally.

**Can he do it?** If the draw is favorable and he avoids a 5-hour slugfest in the first week, he is a serious title contender.
