## Season Averages (Dec 2025)
*   **Points Per Game (PPG):** 24.2
*   **Rebounds (RPG):** 7.8
*   **Assists (APG):** 8.1
*   **Field Goal %:** 51.5%

## Context
While his scoring volume has dipped slightly to accommodate **Anthony Davis** and **Luka Doncic** (who joined via trade/free agency scenarios common in 2025 predictions), LeBron's efficiency remains sky-high. He has transitioned into a "Point Forward" role, orchestrating the offense.

## Milestones Watch
*   **45,000 Points:** LeBron is inching closer to the mythical 45k career points mark, unimaginable for any future player.
*   **Playoff Push:** With the Lakers currently stabilizing in the West, LeBron looks set for another postseason run.

**Legacy:** There is no "washed" king here. Just a smarter, more tactical one.
