# Donovan Mitchell and the Cavaliers: The clock is Ticking

Despite signing a massive extension in 2024, the noise surrounding **Donovan Mitchell** and his future in Cleveland is getting louder as we head into 2026.

## The Contract Situation
Mitchell is under contract, but the devil is in the details. He has a **player option for the 2025-26 season**.
*   **The Scenario**: If he declines that option, he becomes an unrestricted free agent in July 2026.
*   **The Leverage**: This gives Mitchell immense power. If the Cavaliers don't make a deep playoff run this year, he could walk for nothing.

## Trade Buzz
Sources say rival GMs are already calling Cleveland.
*   **The Cavs Stance**: For now, Mitchell (along with Evan Mobley) is considered "**untouchable**."
*   **The Reality**: If Cleveland senses he won't re-sign, they will be forced to trade him next summer to recoup assets.

## The Knicks Connection
The New York Knicks speculation never truly died. With Mitchell being a NY native, they remain the favorite destination if he ever requests a move.
