# NBA Power Rankings: The 2026 Championship Contenders

**Dec 29, 2025:** As we flip the calendar to 2026, the NBA landscape is starting to solidify. While the "Christmas Day" games gave us some surprises, the cream of the crop remains consistent. Here are our **Global Power Rankings** heading into January.

## 1. Denver Nuggets (24-8) 
Nikola Jokic is well on his way to another MVP trophy. The Nuggets' efficiency on offense is at an all-time high, especially with the emergence of their young bench players. Their Christmas win over Minnesota proved they are still the team to beat in the West.

## 2. Boston Celtics (25-7)
The defending Eastern Conference champs are on cruise control. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have combined for 55 PPG in December. Their defense remains a top-3 unit, allowing the fewest corner threes in the league.

## 3. Minnesota Timberwolves (22-10)
Anthony Edwards has taken the leap into "Face of the League" territory. Despite a tough loss to Denver, the Wolves' size (Gobert and KAT/Reid) remains a matchup nightmare for almost everyone else.

## 4. Oklahoma City Thunder (21-11)
The youngest contender is no longer just "talented." Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a tactical surgeon, and Chet Holmgren’s rim protection has kept them in the top 5 net-rating teams all season.

## 5. Philadelphia 76ers (20-12)
If Joel Embiid stays healthy, the Sixers are dangerous. Tyrese Maxey has developed into a secondary superstar, taking the playmaking load off the veteran legs of the roster.

## Notable Climbers
*   **Golden State Warriors:** Steph Curry’s Christmas heroics have pushed the Warriors back into the conversation for a top-6 seed.
*   **Houston Texans:** (Wait, wrong sport!) **Houston Rockets:** Alperen Sengun is averaging 25/11/7 in his last five games.

**The Outlook:** A Nuggets vs. Celtics Finals in June 2026 is looking more likely with every passing week.
