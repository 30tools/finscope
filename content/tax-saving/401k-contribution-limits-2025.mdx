Saving for retirement is one of the most critical financial goals you will ever set. And if your employer offers a 401(k) plan, you have access to one of the most powerful tools for building wealth. But a common question haunts nearly every employee: *How much should I actually put in?*

In this guide, we break down the 2025 contribution limits, the magic of employer matching, and strategies to decide the right percentage for your paycheck.

## The Short Answer: At Least the Match

If you take nothing else away from this article, remember this: **Contribute at least enough to get your full employer match.**

Most employers offer a "match"—for example, they might match 50% of your contributions up to 6% of your salary. This is literally **free money**. It represents a guaranteed 50% or 100% return on your investment immediately, a return you will likely never find in the stock market alone.

## 2025 Contribution Limits: Know Your Numbers

For 2025, the IRS has adjusted the limits for 401(k) plans to account for inflation.

*   **Employee Contribution Limit:** The maximum you can contribute as an employee is **$23,500**.
*   **Catch-Up Contribution:** If you are age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional **$7,500**, bringing your total allowed employee contribution to **$31,000**.
*   **Total Limit (Employee + Employer):** The combined limit for employee and employer contributions is **$70,000** (or $77,500 for those 50+).

## Strategy 1: The "15% Rule"

A common rule of thumb in the financial planning community is to save **15% of your gross income** for retirement. This includes both your contribution and your employer's match.

For example, if you earn $80,000 a year and your employer contributes 5% ($4,000), you should aim to contribute the remaining 10% ($8,000) yourself.

## Strategy 2: Maxing Out for Tax Breaks

Traditional 401(k) contributions are made *pre-tax*. This means every dollar you contribute lowers your taxable income for the year.

If you are in a high tax bracket (e.g., 24% or 32%), maximizing your 401(k) to the full **$23,500** limit can save you thousands of dollars in federal income taxes today. The trade-off is that you will pay taxes on that money when you withdraw it in retirement.

## What If I Can't Afford 15%?

Life is expensive. If you can't hit 15% or max out the limit, don't panic. Start small and use the **"1% Escalation"** method:

1.  Start at a comfortable percentage (e.g., 6% to get the match).
2.  Set a calendar reminder to increase your contribution by **1% every year**.
3.  Alternatively, increase your contribution every time you get a raise. Since you were already living on your previous salary, you won't miss the extra money.

## Roth 401(k) vs. Traditional 401(k)

Many employers now offer a Roth 401(k) option.
*   **Traditional:** Tax break *now*, pay taxes *later*.
*   **Roth:** Pay taxes *now*, tax-free withdrawals *later*.

If you expect your income (and tax bracket) to be significantly higher in retirement than it is today, a Roth 401(k) might be the better mathematical choice, even though you don't get the tax deduction today.

## Summary

There is no single "perfect" number, but the hierarchy of saving usually looks like this:
1.  **Fund 401(k) to the Match:** Don't leave free money on the table.
2.  **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:** Credit cards > 15% APR should be killed before saving more.
3.  **Fund an HSA (if eligible):** The triple-tax advantage makes this a secret retirement weapon.
4.  **Max Out Roth IRA / 401(k):** Aim for 15-20% of your total income.
