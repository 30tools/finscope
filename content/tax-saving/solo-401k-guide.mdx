For freelancers, consultants, and side-hustlers, taxes can be brutal. You pay income tax *plus* the 15.3% self-employment tax.
But being your own boss also unlocks the "Ferrari" of retirement accounts: the **Solo 401(k)**.

In 2025, this account allows you to shelter up to **$69,000** (or $76,500 if age 50+) from the IRS. Here is how it works and why it beats the SEP IRA.

## What is a Solo 401(k)?
It is a traditional 401(k) plan covering a [business](https://unstory.app/business) with no employees other than the owner (and their spouse).
Because you play two roles—**Employee** and **Employer**—you get to contribute twice.

## How the Contribution Limits Work (2025)

### 1. The Employee Contribution (Elective Deferral)
Just like a corporate job, you can contribute **100% of your earning1281** up to **$23,000** for 2025.
*   *Bonus:* You can make this as a **Roth** contribution (pay tax now, tax-free growth forever) or **Traditional** (tax deduction now).

### 2. The Employer Contribution (Profit Sharing)
As the boss, your [business](https://unstory.app/business) can contribute an additional **20% of your net self-employment income**.
*   This is always pre-tax (tax-deductible to the business).

**Total Limit:** The sum of Employee + Employer contributions cannot exceed **$69,000**.
If you are 50 or older, you get a "Catch-Up" contribution of $7,500, raising the total to **$76,500**.

## Solo 401(k) vs. SEP IRA

Many accountants suggest a SEP IRA because it's easier to set up. But the Solo 401(k) is superior for most people.

| Feature | Solo 401(k) | SEP IRA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max Contribution** | Higher at lower income levels (due to employee deferral) | limited to ~20% of profit |
| **Roth Option?** | **Yes** (Mega Backdoor Roth possible) | No (Traditional only) |
| **Catch-Up (50+)?** | Yes ($7,500) | No |
| **Loans?** | **Yes** (Borrow up to $50k from yourself) | No |
| **Paperwork** | Requires Form 5500 once assets > $250k | Minimal |

**Example:**
You earn $50,000 freelance.
*   **SEP IRA:** You can contribute ~$10,000 (20%).
*   **Solo 401(k):** You can contribute **$23,000** (Employee) + ~$10,000 (Employer) = **$33,000**.
*   *Winner:* Solo 401(k) lets you save 3x more!

## How to Open One
You can open a free Solo 401(k) at major brokerages like Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.
1.  **Get an EIN:** You need an Employer Identification Number from the IRS (freelancers usually rely on SSN, but a 401k needs an EIN). It takes 5 minutes online.
2.  **Fill out the Adoption Agreement:** Choose your plan rules.
3.  **Fund it:** contributions must be made by your tax filing deadline (usually April 15).

**Critical Rule:** You must have the plan "established" (signed paperwork) by **December 31st** of the tax year to make contributions for that year. You can fund it later, but the plan must exist before New Year's Eve.

## Conclusion
If you are self-employed and want to slash your tax bill aggressively, skip the SEP IRA. The Solo 401(k) requires slightly more setup but offers unmatched power to build wealth tax-free.
