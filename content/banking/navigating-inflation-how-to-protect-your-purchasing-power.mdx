# Navigating Inflation: How to Protect Your Purchasing Power

*Published on 12/21/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

Inflation is not just a news headline. It is a tax on your savings.
If inflation is 4% and your bank pays you 0.01% interest, you are effectively **losing 3.99% of your wealth** every single year.
In 20 years, your $100,000 will only buy $45,000 worth of goods.

You cannot stop inflation. But you can outrun it.

## Strategy 1: The First Defense (I-Bonds)

**Series I Savings Bonds (I-Bonds)** are government-backed bonds designed specifically to match inflation.
*   **How it works:** The interest rate resets every 6 months based on the CPI (Consumer Price Index).
*   **The Catch:** You can only buy $10,000 per year, and you cannot touch the money for 12 months.
*   **Verdict:** The safest place for your emergency fund during high inflation.

## Strategy 2: The Equity Shield (Stocks)

Historically, the stock market (S&P 500) returns about **10% per year**.
Even with 4% inflation, you are earning a **6% real return**.
Companies can raise prices to match inflation. Your cash cannot. That makes owning companies (stocks) one of the best long-term hedges.

## Strategy 3: The Hard Asset (Real Estate/REITs)

When the price of milk goes up, the price of rent usually goes up too.
Owning real estate (or Real Estate Investment Trusts - REITs) provides a natural hedge because property values and rental income tend to rise with inflation.

## What NOT To Do

1.  **Hoard Cash:** "Cash is Trash" during inflation. Keep enough for emergencies, but invest the rest.
2.  **Buy Long-Term Bonds:** If interest rates rise to fight inflation, bond prices crash. Be careful with long-duration fixed income.

## Final Verdict

The only way to lose to inflation is to do nothing. By moving your money from a dead checking account into **I-Bonds**, **High-Yield Savings**, or **Index Funds**, you stop the bleeding and start building wealth.
