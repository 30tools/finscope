# Wells Fargo vs Bank of America: Which Big Bank Wins in 2025?

*Published on 12/20/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

If you are choosing between Wells Fargo and Bank of America (BofA), you are likely looking for **access** (branches everywhere) rather than **yield** (high interest).
Neither bank will pay you respectable interest on your savings (0.01% is standard).
So, we have to judge them on: **Technology, Fees, and Perks.**

## 1. Technology (Winner: Bank of America)
Bank of America has arguably the best mobile app of any legacy bank. It includes Erica (an AI assistant) and comprehensive budgeting tools.
Wells Fargo's app is functional but feels dated.
*   **Result:** If you live on your phone, choose **Bank of America**.

## 2. Fees (Tie - Both Bad)
Both banks are fee-heavy.
*   **Checking Fees:** Both charge ~$12/month unless you have direct deposit or a minimum balance ($1,500).
*   **Overdraft Fees:** Both have reduced these recently, but they still exist ($10 - $35).
*   **Result:** Tie. (Avoid both if you want free banking).

## 3. Perks & Rewards (Winner: Bank of America)
This is BofA's ace in the hole: **The Preferred Rewards Program.**
If you keep money with BofA (or Merrill Edge investment accounts), you get massive boosters on credit card rewards.
*   **Gold ($20k+ assets):** 25% Rewards Bonus.
*   **Platinum ($50k+ assets):** 50% Rewards Bonus.
*   **Platinum Honors ($100k+ assets):** 75% Rewards Bonus.

Wells Fargo has no comparable ecosystem.

## 4. Reputation (Winner: Not Wells Fargo)
Wells Fargo is still recovering from the "Fake Accounts Scandal" where employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts. While they are trying to clean up their act, the trust deficit remains.

## Final Verdict

If you must choose a big bank:
*   **Bank of America** is the better product, especially if you have over $20,000 to invest (Preferred Rewards).
*   **Wells Fargo** should only be your choice if there is a branch right next to your house and convenience is your only metric.
