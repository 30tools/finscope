# Marcus by Goldman Sachs HYSA Review 2025: Is It Still King?

*Published on 12/20/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

For years, **Marcus by Goldman Sachs** was the "default" recommendation for a High-Yield Savings Account. It had the highest rates, the best app, and the prestige of Goldman Sachs.

But in 2025, the competition is fierce. SoFi, Wealthfront, and BrioDirect are offering rates topping 5.00%. Marcus is currently sitting around **4.40% APY**.
So, is there any reason to stick with Marcus?
**Yes. Reliability.**

## The Good

### 1. The "No-Nonsense" Interface
Marcus doesn't try to sell you crypto. It doesn't have a social feed. It is a savings account.
The app is beautiful, fast, and crash-free. If you want simplicity, Marcus wins.

### 2. The Referral Bonus (5.40% APY)
This is Marcus's secret weapon.
The base rate is 4.40%. But if you refer a friend (or use a referral link), you get a **+1.00% boost** for 3 months.
That brings your rate to **5.40%**, which beats almost everyone.
*   *Strategy:* You can refer up to 5 friends a year, keeping your rate boosted year-round.

### 3. Same-Day Transfers
Marcus is incredibly fast. Push/Pull transfers to external banks often clear in 24 hours.

## The Bad

### 1. No Checking Account
Marcus is strictly savings (and CDs). You cannot get a debit card. You cannot write checks.
If you want an "all-in-one" bank, look at **SoFi**.

### 2. Lower Base Rate
If you run out of referrals, 4.40% is good, but it's not *great* compared to Wealthfront's 5.00%.

## Final Verdict

**Who is Marcus for?**
*   The minimalist who wants a safe bucket for their Emergency Fund.
*   The networker who can refer 2-3 friends a year to keep the bonus active.

**Who should look elsewhere?**
*   If you want to earn 5.00% without doing any work (referrals), go with **Wealthfront** or **BrioDirect**.
