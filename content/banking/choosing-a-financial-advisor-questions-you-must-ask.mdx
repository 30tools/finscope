# Choosing a Financial Advisor: 7 Questions You Must Ask

*Published on 12/21/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

Hiring a financial advisor is one of the most intimate decisions you will make. You are essentially trusting a stranger to safeguard your future, your retirement, and your children's inheritance.

Yet, most people spend more time researching which TV to buy than vetting their financial planner.

The industry is filled with confusing titles. "Wealth Manager," "Financial Consultant," and "Investment Advisor" can mean completely different things. Some are legal fiduciaries required to act in your best interest; others are essentially salespeople paid to sell you expensive products.

Here is your battle-tested guide to hiring the right partner.

## The Most Important Distinction: Fiduciary vs. Broker

Before you ask anything else, you must understand this difference:

*   **Fiduciary:** Legally obligated to put *your* interests first. They cannot recommend a product just because it pays them a higher commission.
*   **Broker (Suitability Standard):** required only to recommend products that are "suitable" for you. They can (and often do) steer you toward funds that pay them massive kickbacks, even if a cheaper, better option exists.

**Rule #1:** Never hire a non-fiduciary.

## The 7 Critical Questions to Ask

Bring this list to your first meeting. Any hesitation in answering these is a major red flag.

### 1. "Are you a Fiduciary 100% of the time?"
Some advisors are "dual-registered," meaning they can switch hats. You want someone who is a fiduciary *always*.

### 2. "How exactly do you get paid?"
There are three main models:
*   **Fee-Only (Best):** They charge a flat fee or a percentage of assets (e.g., 1% of your portfolio). They accept *zero* commissions.
*   **Fee-Based (Confusing):** They charge a fee *plus* they take commissions on insurance or products. Avoid this conflict of interest.
*   **Commission-Only (Worst):** They are "free" to talk to, but they make money by selling you loaded mutual funds and annuities.

### 3. "What are your 'all-in' costs?"
An advisor might say their fee is 1%. But the funds they put you in might charge another 0.5%. And the custodian might charge $50/year. Ask for the **total expense ratio** of the portfolio they recommend.

### 4. "What is your investment philosophy?"
If they talk about "beating the market," "picking hot stocks," or "timing the dip," run.
You want an advisor who preaches **diversification**, **asset allocation**, and **long-term discipline**.

### 5. "Do you provide comprehensive planning or just investment management?"
You likely need more than just stock picking. Does their fee include tax planning, estate planning, and retirement projections? If not, what are you paying for?

### 6. "Who is your typical client?"
If they usually work with clients who have $10M+ and you have $500k, you will be a small fish in a big pond. You want an advisor who specializes in people *like you*.

### 7. "Where will my money be held?"
**Never** write a check directly to the advisor. Your money should be held at a third-party custodian like **Charles Schwab**, **Fidelity**, or **Pershing**. This prevents Bernie Madoff-style fraud.

## Alternatives to a Human Advisor

In 2025, you might not need a human at all.
*   **Robo-Advisors (Betterment, Wealthfront):** Great for portfolios under $100k. They automate everything for a low fee (0.25%).
*   **Flat-Fee Planners:** You pay a one-time fee ($2,000 - $5,000) for a comprehensive plan, then manage it yourself.

## Final Verdict

Trust, but verify. A good financial advisor is worth their weight in gold, keeping you disciplined when the market crashes. A bad one is a vampire that slowly drains your wealth through hidden fees. Ask the hard questions upfront.
