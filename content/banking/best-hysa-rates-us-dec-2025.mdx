# Best High Yield Savings Accounts (HYSA) in the US

Inflation is real, but so are high interest rates. If your emergency fund is sitting in a traditional bank (like Chase or Bank of America) earning 0.01%, you are literally losing money.

In December 2025, online banks are fighting for your deposits. Here are the top contenders offering **FDIC-insured** safety and high returns.

## Top Picks for December 2025

### 1. Marcus by Goldman Sachs
*   **APY**: 4.40% (Referral bonus can boost this to 5.40%)
*   **Min Balance**: $0
*   **Why we love it**: Same-day transfers and absolutely zero fees. The interface is clean and simple.

### 2. Ally Bank
*   **APY**: 4.25%
*   **Features**: "Buckets" feature helps you visualize saving goals (e.g., Vacation, Wedding).
*   **Support**: 24/7 customer support that actually answers the phone.

### 3. SoFi Checking & Savings
*   **APY**: 4.50% (Requires Direct Deposit)
*   **Bonus**: Up to $300 sign-up bonus.
*   **Verdict**: Best for those who want an all-in-one banking app.

## What to Look For?

1.  **FDIC Insurance**: Never direct deposit money into a "fintech" app that doesn't clearly state it is FDIC insured up to $250,000.
2.  **No Monthly Fees**: A savings account should never charge you a maintenance fee.
3.  **Liquidity**: Ensure you can withdraw your money instantly (or within 1 business day).

> **Pro Tip:** Rates are variable. If the Fed cuts rates in 2026, these will go down. Lock in your savings now!
