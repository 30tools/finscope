# The Rise of Green Banking: Best ESG Banks in 2025

*Published on 12/20/2025 by Unstory Team*

When you deposit $1,000 at Chase or Citi, it doesn't sit in a vault. The bank lends it out.
Historically, big banks lend trillions to **Fossil Fuel** companies, **Private Prisons**, and **Weapons Manufacturers**.

If you care about the planet, your choice of bank is more impactful than recycling or driving a Prius.
Enter **Green Banking**.

## What Makes a Bank "Green"?

1.  **Fossil Free:** They pledge $0 funding to oil, gas, and coal exploration.
2.  **Sustainability:** They lend to solar projects, regenerative farming, and affordable housing.
3.  **B-Corp Certified:** They meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance.

## Top Green Banks in 2025

### 1. Amalgamated Bank
America's largest socially responsible bank. They have been fighting for workers' rights and climate justice for decades.
*   **Perks:** Full-service online banking, competitive savings rates.

### 2. Atmos Financial
A fintech that uses 100% of deposits to fund solar and clean energy.
*   **Perks:** High APY checking accounts.

### 3. Aspiration
A popular neobank that plants trees with every swipe.
*   **Perks:** "Pay What Is Fair" fees, cash back on sustainable brands.

## Is Green Banking Safe?

Yes. Legitimate Green Banks are **FDIC Insured** (often through partner banks). Your money is just as safe as it is at Wells Fargo.

## Final Verdict

Voting with your wallet is powerful. By moving your deposits to a Green Bank, you force the financial system to change. Plus, you often get better fees and customer service in the process.
