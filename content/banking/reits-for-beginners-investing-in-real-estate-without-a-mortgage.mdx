# REITs for Beginners: Investing in Real Estate Without a Mortgage

*Published on 12/21/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

Owning rental property is the American Dream.
Fixing a clogged toilet at 3 AM is the American Nightmare.

Enter the **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).**
A REIT is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate. By law, they must pay out **90% of their taxable income** to shareholders as dividends.

This means you can own a piece of a Manhattan skyscraper, a shopping mall, or a data center for the price of a single share ($50 - $100).

## Why Investors Love REITs

### 1. High Yields
Because they are forced to distribute 90% of profits, REITs often pay dividends of **4% - 6%** or higher. Compare that to the 1.5% yield of the S&P 500.

### 2. Liquidity
Selling a house takes months. Selling a REIT takes seconds. You can buy and sell them on Robinhood or Fidelity just like any other stock.

### 3. Diversification
Real Estate moves differently than Tech Stocks. Adding REITs to your portfolio can lower your volatility.

## Types of REITs (Examples)

*   **Residential:** Apartment buildings. (e.g., **AvalonBay Communities**)
*   **Retail:** Shopping malls and grocery stores. (e.g., **Realty Income - O**)
*   **Industrial:** Amazon warehouses. (e.g., **Prologis**)
*   **Data Centers:** The servers powering the internet. (e.g., **Equinix**)

## The "Lazy" Way: VNQ
If you don't want to pick individual companies, just buy **VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF).**
It owns almost everything. You get instant exposure to thousands of properties for a low 0.12% expense fee.

## The Tax Catch
REIT dividends are usually taxed as "Ordinary Income," not the lower "Qualified Dividend" rate.
**Pro Tip:** Hold your REITs in a tax-advantaged account like a **Roth IRA** to avoid a big tax bill.

## Final Verdict
REITs are the best way for 99% of people to invest in real estate. Let the professionals manage the tenants; you just cash the checks.
