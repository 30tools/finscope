# Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA: The 2025 Guide

The IRS contribution limit for IRAs has risen to **$7,000** for 2025 (and $8,000 if you're 50+). But sticking that money in the *wrong* account could cost you thousands in taxes later.

Should you pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional)?

## The Difference

| Feature | Roth IRA | Traditional IRA |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tax Break** | None now. **Tax-Free** withdrawals in retirement. | Tax deduction now. **Taxable** withdrawals later. |
| **Withdrawals** | Contributions can be withdrawn **anytime penalty-free**. | Penalty if withdrawn before age 59½. |
| **Income Limit** | Yes (You can't contribute if you earn too much). | No contribution limit, but deduction is limited. |

## Why Roth Usually Wins

For most young professionals or those early in their careers: **Roth is King.**

1.  **Tax-Free Growth**: If you invest $7,000 today and it grows to $70,000 over 30 years, you pay **$0 taxes** on that $63,000 of profit.
2.  **Emergency Fund Backup**: Since you can withdraw your *contributions* (not earnings) anytime penalty-free, a Roth IRA doubles as a backup emergency fund.

## When to Choose Traditional?

Choose Traditional if:
*   You are in a **very high tax bracket** right now (e.g., 32% or higher) and expect to be in a much lower bracket when you retire.
*   You need the upfront tax deduction to lower your AGI.

> **Strategy**: If you earn too much for a Roth (>$161k single), look into the "Backdoor Roth IRA" strategy.
