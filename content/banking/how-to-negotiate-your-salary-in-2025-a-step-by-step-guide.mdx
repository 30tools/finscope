# How to Negotiate Your Salary in 2025: A Step-by-Step Guide

*Published on 12/21/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

The biggest financial mistake you can make isn't buying too many lattes. It's accepting the first salary offer you receive.
A $5,000 increase in your starting salary, compounded over a 40-year career with 3% annual raises, is worth over **$375,000**.

Negotiating isn't rude. It's expected. Here is how to do it without sweating.

## Step 1: Know Your Number (The Research)

You cannot negotiate without data. "I want more money" is a wish. "The market rate for this role is $90k" is a fact.
Use these sources:
*   **Levels.fyi:** The gold standard for tech and corporate roles.
*   **Glassdoor:** Good for general estimates, but often outdated.
*   **Talking to Peers:** Ask friends in the industry. "What is the range for a Senior Analyst these days?"

## Step 2: The Golden Rule (Don't Say a Number First)

Recruiters love to ask: "What are your salary expectations?"
If you say a number, you lose leverage.
*   If you say $70k and they budgeted $90k, they will give you $70k. You lost $20k instantly.
*   If you say $110k and they budgeted $90k, they might ghost you.

**The Script:**
*"I'm flexible on the numbers. Right now, I'm focused on finding the right fit. What is the budget you have allocated for this role?"*

## Step 3: The Counter-Offer

They offer you $80,000. You wanted $90,000.
Do not say "Okay." Do not say "No."
Say: **"Thank you for the offer. I'm really excited about the team. However, based on my experience and market research, I was expecting something in the $90,000 to $95,000 range. Can we get closer to that?"**

Then—and this is successful negotiation's secret weapon—**stop talking**.
Silence is uncomfortable. Let them fill it.

## Step 4: Negotiate "Total Comp"

If they can't move on the base salary because of "HR bands," pivot to other levers:
*   **Signing Bonus:** One-time cash is easy for them to approve.
*   **Restricted Stock Units (RSUs):** Equity can be worth more than cash.
*   **Remote Work Days:** Time is money.
*   **Extra PTO:** A week of vacation is worth ~2% of your salary.

## Final Verdict

Companies expect you to negotiate. They rarely pull an offer just because you asked for 10% more. Be polite, be firm, and back up your request with data. Your future self (and your bank account) will thank you.
