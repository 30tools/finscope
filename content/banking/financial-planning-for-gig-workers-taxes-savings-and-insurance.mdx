# Financial Planning for Gig Workers: Taxes, Savings, and Insurance

*Published on 12/21/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

The "Gig Economy" isn't just Uber drivers anymore. It's graphic designers, consultants, writers, and coders.
The freedom of being your own boss is intoxicating. You can work from Bali, set your own hours, and fire bad clients.

But there is a dark side: **Financial Instability.**
When you don't have a W-2 paycheck hitting your account every two weeks, you need a different playbook.

Here is the survival guide for the self-employed.

## Rule #1: Separate Your Money IMMEDIATELY

The #1 mistake new freelancers make is co-mingling funds. They use their personal checking account for business expenses.
**Stop doing this.**
*   Open a **Business Checking Account** (e.g., Novo, Bluevine, Chase Business).
*   All client payments go IN here.
*   All business expenses (software, equipment) come OUT of here.
*   You pay yourself a "salary" by transferring a fixed amount to your personal checking account.

## Rule #2: The Tax Monster (15.3% + Income Tax)

When you are an employee, your boss pays half your FICA taxes. When you are self-employed, you pay **both halves**. This is called the **Self-Employment Tax (15.3%)**.
This is *in addition* to your regular federal and state income tax.

**The Golden Rule:** Set aside **30% of every single paycheck** into a separate savings account labeled "Taxes."
Do not touch this money. It belongs to the IRS. If you spend it, April 15th will destroy you.

## Rule #3: Feasts and Famines (The "Hill & Valley" Strategy)

Gig work is cyclical. One month you make $12,000; the next you make $2,000.
To survive the "Valleys" (months with no income), you must shave off the top of the "Hills."

**The Strategy:**
Calculate your "Minimum Viable Income" (e.g., $4,000 to pay bills).
*   In a $12,000 month, pay yourself $4,000.
*   Put $3,600 away for taxes (30%).
*   Put the remaining $4,400 into a "Buffer" savings account.
*   In a $2,000 month, pull $2,000 from the Buffer to pay yourself.

## Rule #4: Insurance is On You

You don't have HR to handle benefits.
1.  **Health Insurance:** Check the Marketplace (Healthcare.gov). Premiums act as a tax deduction for the self-employed.
2.  **Disability Insurance:** If you break your hand and can't type/drive, your income hits $0. Basic disability insurance is cheap and vital.
3.  **Liability Insurance:** Protects you if a client sues you for "errors and omissions."

## Final Verdict

Financial planning for gig workers is 90% defensive. If you can master the discipline of **saving for taxes** and **living on less than you earn during the good months**, you will enjoy a level of freedom that 9-to-5 employees can only dream of.
