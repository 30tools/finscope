# The FIRE Movement Guide: How to Retire Early and Sustain It

*Published on 12/21/2025 by Unstory Strategy Team*

**F.I.R.E.** stands for **F**inancial **I**ndependence, **R**etire **E**arly.
It is a philosophy that challenges the traditional path of "Work until 65, then die."
Instead, FIRE adherents aggressively save 50-70% of their income so they can quit the rat race decades early.

## The Math: The 4% Rule

The core of FIRE is the **4% Rule**.
Historically, if you invest in a mix of stocks and bonds, you can withdraw **4%** of your portfolio every year without ever running out of money.

**How to find your FIRE Number:**
Take your annual expenses and multiply by **25**.

*   Detailed Example:
    *   You spend **$40,000** per year.
    *   $40,000 x 25 = **$1,000,000**.
    *   Once you have $1M invested, you are financially independent. You can quit your job forever.

## Variations of FIRE

Not everyone wants to live on rice and beans.
1.  **LeanFIRE:** Living on <$40k/year. Extreme frugality. Retire very fast.
2.  **FatFIRE:** Living on >$100k/year. You want to retire rich, travel first class, and eat out. require a larger portfolio ($2.5M+).
3.  **CoastFIRE:** You save heavily in your 20s, then "coast." You stop saving for retirement and just work a low-stress job to cover current bills, letting your nest egg compound until 65.

## How to Start

1.  **Track Everything:** You cannot calculate your FIRE number if you don't know your annual expenses.
2.  **Cut the Big Three:** Housing, Transport, and Food are 70% of the average budget. Optimize these first.
3.  **Invest:** Cash is not an investment. You need the growth of the Stock Market (check our [Index Fund Guide](https://unstory.app/banking/index-funds-vs-mutual-funds-a-2025-investor-comparison)) to reach your number.

## Final Verdict

FIRE isn't really about "Retiring Early." It's about **Financial Independence.** Even if you love your job, knowing you *could* quit tomorrow gives you unmatched freedom and confidence.
