# The Florida Summit: Can Trump and Zelenskyy End the War?

## The "Deal-Maker" Approach
Donald Trump has campaigned on the promise of ending the war "in 24 hours." While the reality is far more complex, the Florida summit represents the most significant diplomatic push since the 2024 US Election. 
Zelenskyy’s team is reportedly presenting a **"Victory through Security"** plan, which emphasizes long-term defense guarantees in exchange for potential flexible territorial boundaries.

## The Sticking Points
Despite the optimism from the Florida sun, the obstacles remain mountainous:
1.  **Territory:** Kyiv maintains a firm stance on its 1991 borders, while Moscow (not present at the talks) continues to hold significant eastern swathes.
2.  **NATO Status:** Russia has consistently stated that a neutral Ukraine is a non-negotiable requirement for peace.
3.  **The "Temporary Ceasefire" Problem:** Both Russian and U.S. sources have hinted that a "frozen conflict" is not the goal, as it would only allow for re-armament.

## Geopolitical Implications
If a preliminary framework is reached in early 2026, it would spark a massive reconstruction boom.
*   **European Energy:** A stable Ukraine would likely lead to a normalization of European energy prices.
*   **Global [Food](https://unstory.app/food) Security:** As one of the world's largest grain exporters, a peaceful Ukraine is vital for stabilizing global food costs.

**The Verdict:** No one expects a treaty to be signed this weekend. However, the move away from the battlefield toward the boardroom is the first sign of hope for millions in over three years.
