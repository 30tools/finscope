# Red Alert at Chernobyl: Drone Strike Damages Safe Confinement

In a concerning development for global nuclear safety, the **New Safe Confinement** structure at the **Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant** has been confirmed damaged by a drone strike.

## The Incident
*   **What Happened**: An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) struck the massive arch structure that covers the destroyed Reactor 4.
*   **The Damage**: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the structure's "primary safety function" has been compromised. While the reactor itself remains contained, the outer shell requires significant repairs.

## Radiation Levels
Authorities report that **radiation levels remain within normal limits** for the exclusion zone. There is no immediate threat to neighboring countries, but the breach highlights the vulnerability of critical nuclear infrastructure in conflict zones.

## The Repair Timeline
Engineers estimate it will take "several years" to fully restore the dome's integrity, complicating ongoing efforts to dismantle the unstable reactor inside.
