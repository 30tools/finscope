# NORAD Mission Complete: Santa Delivers 8.2 Billion Gifts

For the 70th consecutive year, the **North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)** tracked Santa Claus as he circumnavigated the globe. The 2025 mission was a resounding success.

## The Stats
*   **Gifts Delivered**: **8.2 Billion**
*   **Distance Traveled**: ~175,000 miles (estimated)
*   **cookies Consumed**: Countless.

## High-Tech Tracking
Using a network of satellites and radar (and "Rudolph's nose infrared signature"), NORAD provided real-time updates to millions of children. Volunteers at the Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado took over 100,000 calls from curious kids asking for Santa's location.

## Rest Mode
Santa is now confirmed to be back at the North Pole, resting up for 2026.
