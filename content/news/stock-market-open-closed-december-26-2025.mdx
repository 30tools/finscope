# Stock Market Schedule: Open for Business on December 26

After a midweek break for Christmas, Wall Street is back to work.

## The Status
*   **NYSE & NASDAQ**: **OPEN**
*   **Hours**: Standard trading hours apply (9:30 AM – 4:00 PM ET).

## What to Expect
Trading volume is typically lower during the week between Christmas and New Year's, often referred to as the "Santa Claus Rally" period. However, markets are fully operational, so investors can buy and sell as usual.

## Bond Market
The bond market also resumes trading today but may have an early close ahead of the weekend. Check with your broker for specific fixed-income trading hours.
