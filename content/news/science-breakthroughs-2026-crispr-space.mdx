# Science in 2026: CRISPR Cures & The Mission to Mars

**Jan 3, 2026:** We are living in the future. The headlines of 2026 read like Isaac Asimov novels.

## 1. CRISPR Goes Mainstream (Casgevy)
The FDA approved Casgevy for sickle cell disease in late 2023, but 2026 is the year of **Mass Adoption**.
*   **The Breakthrough:** It's not just for blood diseases anymore. Clinical trials starting in 2026 are targeting "In Vivo" editing—injecting the editor directly into the body to fix heart disease genes.
*   **The Cost:** Prices are dropping, but [insurance](https://unstory.app/insurance) coverage remains the battleground.

## 2. The Race to Mars (Starship)
Elon Musk's SpaceX is targeting late 2026 for the first **uncrewed Starship landing on Mars**.
*   **The Window:** Earth and Mars align every 26 months. This launch window (late 2026) is critical.
*   **The Goal:** Prove that a heavy ship can enter the Martian atmosphere and land upright. If it succeeds, humans go in 2029.

## 3. Artemis II: Humans at the Moon
NASA is sending four astronauts to orbit the Moon. They won't land (that's Artemis III), but they will go further into deep space than any human since 1972.
*   **The Crew:** A diverse team representing the new era of space exploration.

## 4. AI in Protein Folding
Google DeepMind's AlphaFold 4 is now designing drugs from scratch. In 2026, the first "AI-Designed" cancer drug enters Phase 2 trials.

## Verdict
Science is moving faster than policy. Whether it's editing human DNA or colonizing other planets, 2026 is the year we decide *how* to use these god-like powers.
