# Artemis II: NASA's 2026 Moon Mission Timeline & Crew

**Cape Canaveral, Jan 3, 2026:** Look up at the Moon tonight. Soon, four humans will be circling it.

The **Artemis II** mission is scheduled for late 2026. It is a 10-day test flight to prove the Orion spacecraft can keep humans alive in deep space.

## The Mission Profile
1.  **Launch:** SLS Rocket (The most powerful ever built).
2.  **Orbit:** High Earth Orbit checkouts.
3.  **Trans-Lunar Injection:** Shooting towards the Moon.
4.  **Flyby:** They will loop around the dark side of the Moon (farther than Apollo ever went).
5.  **Return:** A blistering high-speed re-entry into the Pacific Ocean.

## The Crew
*   **Reid Wiseman (Commander):** US Navy Pilot.
*   **Victor Glover (Pilot):** The first person of color to leave LEO (Low Earth Orbit).
*   **Christina Koch (Specialist):** The first woman to go to the Moon.
*   **Jeremy Hansen (Specialist):** Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

## Why It Matters
This isn't a "Flag and Footprints" mission. It is a **Colonization** preamble. We are going back to stay. Artemis III (landing) depends entirely on the success of this flight.
