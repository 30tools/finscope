# Zuckerberg's Peace Offering: Wine, Headphones, and Doughnuts

Living next to a billionaire isn't always quiet. **Mark Zuckerberg** has been making headlines in his Palo Alto neighborhood this December, but not for [tech](https://unstory.app/tech) breakthroughs.

Construction at Zuckerberg's massive residential compound has been causing significant noise disruptions, frustrating local residents.

1.  **Noise-Canceling Headphones**: A practical (if slightly ironic) solution.
2.  **Sparkling Wine**: To take the edge off.
3.  **Krispy Kreme Doughnuts**: A sweet treat.

## Meta News
In [business](https://unstory.app/business) news, reports surfaced this month that Meta is considering cutting its metaverse budget by up to **30%** for 2026, pivoting even harder into Generative AI.
