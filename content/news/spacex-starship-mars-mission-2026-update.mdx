# SpaceX Starship: The 2026 Mars Transfer Window

**Boca Chica, Jan 3, 2026:** In spaceflight, timing is everything. You can't just fly to Mars whenever you want. You have to wait for the planets to align.

That alignment happens in **October/November 2026**.

## The Plan: Uncrewed Landing
SpaceX intends to send **five** uncrewed Starships to Mars in this window.
*   **Goal:** Land safely on the surface.
*   **Risk:** Extremely high. If they crash, no harm done (other than billions of dollars). If they land, the path is cleared for humans in 2029 (the next window).

## The Hardware: Starship V3
The rockets launching in 2026 are monsters. Taller, more powerful, and fully reusable.
*   **Orbit Refueling:** The key [tech](https://unstory.app/tech)nology. To get to Mars, Starship must meet a "Tanker" in Earth orbit to top up fuel. This has never been done at scale.

## The Stakes
If successful, SpaceX becomes not just a launch company, but an interplanetary logistics company. If they fail, the Mars dream is delayed another 2 years. 2026 is the "Go/No-Go" moment.
