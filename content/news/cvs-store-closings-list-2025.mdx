# CVS to Close 270 Stores in 2025: Strategic Shift Explained

If it feels like there is a **CVS** on every corner, that might be changing soon. The pharmacy giant has confirmed it will close approximately **270 locations** in 2025 as part of a massive restructuring effort.

## Why the Closures?
It’s not just about cutting costs; it’s about changing how they do [business](https://unstory.app/business).
1.  **Oversaturation**: In many cities, CVS locations are simply too close together, cannibalizing each other's sales.
2.  **[Retail](https://unstory.app/retail) Theft**: High rates of organized [retail](https://unstory.app/retail) crime have made certain urban locations unprofitable.
3.  **Digital Shift**: With more prescriptions being filled by mail and tele[health](https://unstory.app/health) rising, the need for massive retail footprints is shrinking.

## The Good News
It's not all contractions. CVS plans to open ~30 new "healthcare hubs." These smaller, focused locations will prioritize clinics and [health](https://unstory.app/health) services over selling candy and greeting cards.

## Check Your Local Store
CVS is notifying customers by mail if their prescriptions are being transferred to a nearby location. Keep an eye on your mailbox if you are a regular customer.
