# California Flooding: Atmospheric Rivers Drench the State

December 2025 will be remembered for its wet finish. A series of potent **atmospheric rivers** slammed into California over the Christmas holiday, causing widespread flooding, mudslides, and chaos for travelers.

## The Situation
*   **Records Broken**: Southern California recorded its wettest Christmas in modern history.
*   **Affected Areas**: San Diego, Los Angeles, and Ventura counties are seeing the worst of it. Communities like Wrightwood and Lytle Creek are battling flash floods.
*   **Emergency Declaration**: Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a State of Emergency in several counties to expedite resources and aid.

## Danger Zones
Authorities warn residents to stay off the roads in the following areas due to mudslide risks:
*   Pacific Coast Highway (PCH)
*   Canyon roads in the Hollywood Hills
*   Low-lying areas in the Inland Empire

## Forecast
The rain is expected to taper off by New Year's Eve, but the ground remains oversaturated. Residents should remain vigilant for "delayed" mudslides that can occur days after the rain stops.
