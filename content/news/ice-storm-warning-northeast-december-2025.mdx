# Winter Storm Alert: Ice Storm Freezes the Northeast

Post-holiday travel is facing a major disruption as a severe ice storm moves across the Northeastern United States. Meteorologists have issued **Ice Storm Warnings** and **Winter Weather Advisories** effective from December 25 through December 27, 2025.

## Affected Areas
The storm is impacting a wide corridor, including:
*   Western Pennsylvania
*   Upstate New York
*   New Jersey
*   Connecticut
*   Maryland

## The Threats
*   **Glazed Roads**: Rain is freezing upon contact with the ground, creating "black ice" conditions that are extremely dangerous for drivers.
*   **Power Outages**: Ice accumulation of up to 0.5 inches on power lines and tree branches is expected to cause widespread outages.
*   **Travel Delays**: Flights across the NYC metro area (JFK, LGA, EWR) are experiencing significant delays and cancellations.

## Safety Check
Authorities are urging residents to **stay off the roads** if possible. If you must drive:
1.  Slow down.
2.  Keep an emergency kit in your car (blankets, water, flashlight).
3.  Assume any wet spot on the road is ice.
