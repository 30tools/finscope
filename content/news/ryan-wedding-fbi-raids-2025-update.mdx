# From Olympian to Fugitive: The Hunt for Ryan Wedding Intensifies

The bizarre and dark saga of **Ryan Wedding** continued to unfold in late 2025. The former Canadian Olympic snowboarder, now an alleged drug kingpin, is the target of a massive international manhunt.

## The FBI Raids
In a coordinated strike, Mexican authorities and the FBI raided properties linked to Wedding's organization.
*   **The Haul**: Authorities seized 62 high-end motorcycles, vast quantities of methamphetamine, and even two Olympic medals (though confirmed not to be Wedding's own).
*   **The Charges**: Wedding is accused of running a billion-dollar drug trafficking empire that smuggles cocaine from Colombia through Mexico into the U.S. and Canada. He is also charged with ordering multiple murders.

## The Reward
The FBI has placed a **$15 million reward** on his head—one of the largest bounties currently active. He remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous.

## A Fall from Grace
Wedding competed for Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics. His transformation from elite athlete to the alleged leader of a violent cartel is one of the most shocking criminal turns in sports history.
