# A Historic Milestone: India on the Brink of Malaria Elimination

**New Delhi, Dec 29, 2025:** In a monumental achievement for global health, India has reported a **97% reduction in malaria cases** over the last decade. Government health officials announced today that the nation is on track to achieve "Malaria-Free" status as early as mid-2026, well ahead of the original 2030 target.

## The Strategy That Worked
India’s success is attributed to the **National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME)**, which shifted the focus from broad control to localized, data-driven interventions.
*   **Digital Tracking:** Use of the "Integrated Health Information Platform" (IHIP) allowed health workers to track outbreaks in real-time.
*   **Last-Mile Delivery:** Distribution of over 150 million long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) to high-risk forest and tribal areas.
*   **Treatment:** Free diagnosis and treatment with Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) at all public health facilities.

## The Role of Technology
2025 saw the widespread deployment of **AI-powered mosquito tracking**. Drones equipped with heat-sensing cameras were used to identify stagnant water breeding grounds in dense urban areas like Mumbai and Delhi, allowing for precise larviciding.

## The Road to 2026
To be certified as "Malaria-Free" by the WHO, a country must prove zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years. While some border regions still face challenges, the bulk of the country has been clear for 24 months.

## Why This Matters
Eliminating malaria will save India an estimated **$2 Billion annually** in direct healthcare costs and lost productivity. More importantly, it secures the health of millions of children and pregnant women who are most vulnerable to the disease.

**This is a testament to what public-private partnerships and political will can achieve.**
