## Master Recipe: 45-Minute Chicken Vegetable Soup

### Ingredients
- 1 lb Chicken Breast or Thighs (shredded rotisserie chicken works too!)
- 2 cups Carrots, sliced into rounds
- 2 stalks Celery, diced
- 1 medium Yellow Onion, diced
- 3 cloves Garlic, minced
- 6 cups Low-Sodium Chicken Broth
- 1 tsp Dried Thyme or Oregano
- 2 cups Fresh Spinach or Kale
- 1 tbsp Olive Oil or Butter
- Sea Salt and Black Pepper to taste

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **The Sauté:** Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 6-8 minutes until the onions are translucent.
2. **The Aromatics:** Stir in the garlic and thyme. Cook for only 1 minute until fragrant—don't let the garlic burn!
3. **The Base:** Pour in the chicken broth. If you are using raw chicken, add it now. If you are using pre-cooked shredded chicken, wait until later.
4. **The Simmer:** Bring the pot to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes. This allows the carrot nutrients to infuse into the broth.
5. **The Greens:** If using pre-cooked chicken, add it now to heat through. Finally, stir in the spinach or kale. They only need about 60 seconds to wilt.
6. **The Seasoning:** Taste the broth. This is where you decide if it needs more salt or a crack of fresh pepper.

## 3 Variations to Keep it Interesting

### 1. The "Zesty" Version
Add the juice of half a lemon and a handful of fresh parsley at the very end. The acidity brightens the entire flavor profile and makes the **easy chicken vegetable soup recipe** taste incredibly fresh.

### 2. The Low-Carb "Noodle" Soup
Replace traditional noodles with "Zoodles" (zucchini noodles) or shredded cabbage. You get the same satisfying texture without the heavy carb load.

### 3. The Creamy (No-Dairy) Version
Blend two cups of the cooked soup (including some of the veggies) and pour it back in. This creates a "creamy" thickness without needing heavy cream or flour.

## Storage & Freezing

Soup is the king of meal prep.
- **Fridge:** Store in glass jars for up to 4 days. In fact, it often tastes better the next day as the flavors continue to marry.
- **Freezer:** Freeze in individual portions for an "instant" healthy lunch. It will last 3-4 months in a standard freezer.
- **Reheating:** Reheat on the stove over medium heat. If it has thickened too much in the fridge, add a splash of water or broth.

## FAQ: Soup Secrets

### Can I make this in a Slow Cooker?
Absolutely! Put everything except the spinach in the slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 6-7 hours or HIGH for 3-4 hours. Stir in the spinach at the very end.

### How do I make the broth more flavorful?
The secret is the "Searing" phase. If you're using raw chicken, sear it in the pot first to build a "fond" (browned bits) on the bottom, then deglaze with your broth. This adds a deep, savory layer to the **easy chicken vegetable soup recipe**.

### Is this soup Keto-friendly?
Yes! Carrots have a few carbs, but in a large pot of soup, the "per serving" count is very low. If you're being strict, reduce the carrots and increase the celery and leafy greens.
