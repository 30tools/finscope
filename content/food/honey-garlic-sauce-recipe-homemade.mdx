## Master Recipe: 10-Minute Easy Honey Garlic Sauce

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup Quality Honey
- 4-5 cloves Fresh Garlic, finely minced
- 1/4 cup Low-Sodium Soy Sauce (or Tamari for gluten-free)
- 1 tsp Freshly Grated Ginger (optional, but highly recommended)
- 1 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar (to balance the sweetness)

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Combine:** In a small saucepan or skillet, add all the ingredients.
2. **Simmer:** Turn the heat to medium. Once it starts to bubble, reduce the heat to low.
3. **Thicken:** Stir frequently for about 5 minutes. The honey will caramelize slightly, and the sauce will begin to coat the back of your spoon.
4. **Final Touch:** If you want a thicker, "glaze-like" consistency, you can mix 1 tsp of cornstarch with 1 tsp of water and whisk it in during the last minute.
5. **Serve:** Pour directly over crispy chicken thighs, seared salmon, or roasted cauliflower.

## 3 Variations for Different Diets

### 1. The Spicy Kick
Add 1 tsp of red pepper flakes or sriracha during the simmering process. This creates a "Hot Honey Garlic" profile that is incredible on wings.

### 2. Keto/Low-Carb Version
Replace the honey with a sugar-free maple syrup or a keto-friendly liquid sweetener. Use Coconut Aminos instead of soy sauce to keep it Paleo-compliant.

### 3. The Umami Bomb
Add a splash of fish sauce or toasted sesame oil at the very end. This deepens the flavor and gives it a more authentic "East Asian" character.

## Storage & Make-Ahead Tips

- **Fridge:** Store in a glass mason jar for up to 2 weeks. Because it’s high in sugar (honey) and acid (vinegar), it preserves well.
- **Crystallization:** If the honey starts to crystallize in the fridge, simply place the jar in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes or microwave for 10 seconds.
- **Batch Prep:** Double the recipe and keep it on hand for emergency 15-minute dinners.

## FAQ: Sauce Perfection

### Can I use garlic powder instead?
While you *can*, we don't recommend it for this **easy honey garlic sauce recipe**. The texture of minced garlic frying in the honey is what gives this sauce its soul. If you must use powder, use 1.5 teaspoons.

### My sauce is too thin! What happened?
Honey varies in water content. If it's too thin, just let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes. Remember, it thickens significantly as it cools.

### What should I serve this with?
It’s most famous for "Honey Garlic Chicken," but it’s equally good on roasted Brussels sprouts, grilled shrimp, or even as a dip for pork rinds.
