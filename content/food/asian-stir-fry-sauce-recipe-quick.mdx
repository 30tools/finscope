## FAQ: Stir-Fry Success

### Can I use dry ginger/garlic?
You can, but the flavor won't be nearly as "bright." If you're in a hurry, it works, but fresh ginger is the secret ingredient that makes this **quick Asian stir-fry sauce recipe** taste authentic.

### My sauce got too thick!
Simply add a tablespoon of water or broth and stir. It will thin out immediately.

### How long does the sauce keep?
Unused sauce (without the cornstarch) can stay in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. If you've already added the cornstarch, it's best to use it within 3-4 days.
