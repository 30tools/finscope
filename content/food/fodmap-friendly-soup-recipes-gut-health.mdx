## FAQ: Gut Health and Soup

### How do I get flavor without garlic and onions?
Infused oils are your secret weapon! Garlic-infused olive oil provides the *scent* and *flavor* of garlic without the fermentable fructans. Also, use plenty of fresh herbs like cilantro, parsley, and basil in your **FODMAP friendly soup recipes**.

### Can I use bone broth?
Yes, but many store-bought bone broths are cooked with onions. For a truly safe **FODMAP friendly soup**, it is best to make your own broth using just beef bones or chicken carcasses, water, and salt.

### What about "hidden" FODMAPs?
Always check the labels on bouillon cubes or stock cartons. Terms like "natural flavors" or "vegetable powder" almost always hide onion and garlic.
