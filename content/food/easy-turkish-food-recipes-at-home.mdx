## FAQ: Turkish Cooking Success

### What is "Turkish Pepper Paste"?
Known as *Biber Salçası*, it’s a concentrated paste made from red peppers. If you can't find it for your **easy Turkish food recipes**, you can substitute with a 50/50 mix of tomato paste and smoked paprika.

### Can I make these recipes vegetarian?
Turkish cuisine is incredibly veggie-friendly! Nearly all the mezes (Haydari, Shepherd's Salad) and the Red Lentil Soup are already vegetarian or can be made so by using vegetable broth.

### Why use yogurt with meat?
In Turkey, yogurt is considered a digestive aid. The cool, probiotic-rich yogurt perfectly balances the warm spices and fats of the meats.
