## The "Golden Rule" of Pairing

When choosing sides for fatty fish, remember: **Contrast is Key.** 
- Contrast in **Texture:** Salmon is soft; your side should have a "snap" or crunch.
- Contrast in **Flavor:** Salmon is savory/umami; your side should be bright/acidic.
- Contrast in **Color:** Salmon is pink/orange; green or purple sides make the plate "pop."

## 5 Essential Side Dishes for Salmon

### 1. Garlic Lemon Roasted Asparagus (The Classic)
This is widely considered the #1 pairing for a reason. 
- **The Method:** Roast thin asparagus spears at high heat (400°F) for just 12 minutes.
- **Why it works:** The earthiness of the asparagus grounds the fish, while the lemon juice mimics the citrus notes often used on the salmon itself.

### 2. Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad
A gluten-free, high-protein alternative to rice.
- **The Method:** Mix cooked quinoa with copious amounts of chopped parsley, diced cucumber, tomatoes, and a heavy lemon-olive oil dressing.
- **Why it works:** It’s a "cold" side that provides a refreshing temperature contrast to the hot fish.

### 3. Crispy Smashed Potatoes
Far superior to mashed potatoes for this application.
- **The Method:** Boil baby potatoes, smash them flat with a glass, drizzle with oil, and bake until ultra-crispy.
- **Why it works:** It gives you the "french fry" satisfaction in a much healthier, un-fried format.

### 4. Sautéed Garlicky Spinach / Kale
The nutrient-dense option for low-carb eaters.
- **The Method:** Wilting greens in the same pan you cooked the salmon in (to absorb the omega-3 rich oils) with plenty of garlic.
- **Why it works:** The bitterness of dark leafy greens cuts right through the fat of the salmon belly.

### 5. Honey Glazed Brussels Sprouts
For those who want a sweet-and-savory profile.
- **The Method:** Roast halved sprouts until charred, then toss in a mix of honey and balsamic vinegar.
- **Why it works:** The char brings out a sweetness that mirrors the caramelization on a well-seared salmon fillet.

## FAQ: Salmon Pairing Secrets

### What vegetable goes with teriyaki salmon?
If your salmon has a sweet Asian glaze, stick to steamed broccoli or bok choy. The slight bitterness balances the sugar in the teriyaki sauce perfectly.

### Can I serve cheese with salmon?
Generally, no. The Italians have a rule against mixing cheese and seafood for a reason—the heavy cheese overpowers the delicate fish oils. However, a light sprinkling of Feta in a side salad is the exception.

### What is a good "lazy" side dish?
A bag of pre-washed arugula tossed with lemon juice and olive oil. It takes 30 seconds and the peppery bite of the arugula is one of the **best side dishes for salmon** money can buy.
