By using a creamy base, you also add a luxurious mouthfeel that makes the meal feel significantly more expensive than it actually is.

## Master Recipe: The 5-Minute Creamy Dill Sauce

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup Greek Yogurt (for a healthy, high-protein base) OR Sour Cream (for maximum richness)
- 2 tbsp Fresh Dill, finely chopped (avoid the dried stuff if possible)
- 1 tbsp Fresh Lemon Juice (plus a little zest for extra punch)
- 1 small clove of Garlic, finely minced or grated
- 1/4 tsp Sea Salt
- A pinch of Black Pepper

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **The Prep:** Finely chop your dill, removing the thicker stems. Grate your garlic into a paste so you don't get large "bites" of raw garlic.
2. **The Mix:** In a small glass bowl, combine the yogurt/sour cream, lemon juice, and garlic. Whisk until smooth.
3. **The Folding:** Gently fold in the fresh dill. Using a "folding" motion instead of aggressive whisking helps keep the herbs intact and prevents the sauce from turning green.
4. **The Chill:** Ideally, let the sauce sit in the fridge for 30 minutes before serving. This allows the garlic and dill to infuse into the cream.
5. **The Serving:** Spoon a generous dollop over your salmon just before it leaves the kitchen.

## 3 Healthy Variations

### 1. The Dairy-Free Version
Replace the yogurt with a high-quality cashew cream or a "thick" coconut milk (the part at the top of the can). Add a little extra lemon to mimic the tang of yogurt.

### 2. The Cucumber-Dill (Tzatziki Style)
Grate half a cucumber, squeeze out the excess water, and stir it in. This makes the **creamy dill sauce for salmon recipe** even more refreshing.

### 3. The "Caper" Kick
Add 1 tsp of drained, chopped capers. The saltiness of the capers adds a "tartar sauce" vibe that works perfectly with fried or breaded fish.

## FAQ: Seafood Sauce Secrets

### Can I use dried dill?
You can, but use only 1 teaspoon as dried herbs are more concentrated. However, for this specific **creamy dill sauce for salmon recipe**, the "freshness" is the whole point. If you can find fresh dill, use it!

### What other fish does this work with?
While it’s famous for salmon, it’s equally delicious on trout, cod, halibut, or even grilled shrimp.

### How long does it last in the fridge?
Because of the fresh herbs and lemon juice, it’s best consumed within 3 days. After that, the dill starts to wilt and lose its bright flavor.
