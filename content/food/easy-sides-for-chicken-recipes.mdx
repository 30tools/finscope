## The Strategy: complementing the Bird

Chicken is a "blank canvas." It has a mild flavor that takes on the character of whatever you season it with. Therefore, your **easy sides for chicken** should either:
1. **Mirror the seasoning** (e.g., Lemon Potatoes with Lemon Chicken)
2. **Provide a sauce** (e.g., Creamed Corn with plain Grilled Chicken).

## 5 Go-To Easy Sides for Chicken

### 1. Honey Glazed Carrots
Sweet, vibrant, and kids love them.
- **The Method:** Simmer carrot coins in a little water until soft. Drain the water, add a knob of butter and a drizzle of honey. Turn up the heat to high for 2 minutes to glaze them.
- **Why it works:** The sweetness plays perfectly against savory roasted chicken.

### 2. Cheesy Broccoli "Au Gratin"
If you want to trick picky eaters into eating green things.
- **The Method:** Steam broccoli, then smother it in a quick homemade cheese sauce (cheddar + cream).
- **Why it works:** It adds a richness that lean chicken breast often lacks.

### 3. Greek Salad (Horiatiki)
To keep things light and fresh.
- **The Method:** Big chunks of cucumber, tomato, red onion, kalamata olives, and a block of feta. No lettuce!
- **Why it works:** The acidic vinaigrette cleanses the palate, making it one of the best **easy sides for chicken** in the summer.

### 4. Garlic Butter Rice
A massive upgrade from plain white rice.
- **The Method:** Sauté uncooked rice in butter and garlic until golden *before* adding the water. Cook as normal.
- **Why it works:** It infuses the garlic flavor into every single grain.

### 5. Roasted Sweet Potato Wedges
A healthier alternative to french fries.
- **The Method:** Slice sweet potatoes into wedges. Toss with oil, paprika, and salt. Roast at 425°F for 25 minutes.
- **Why it works:** They are filling, high in Vitamin A, and have a satisfying texture.

## FAQ: Chicken Dinner Wins

### What vegetable goes with fried chicken?
Coleslaw or Corn. You need something crisp or sweet to balance the heavy, salty breading. Avoid heavy starches like pasta.

### Can I make sides in the same pan?
Yes! "Sheet Pan Dinners" are a life hack. Toss potatoes and green beans on the same roasting tray as your chicken thighs. Everything cooks in the same 30-minute window.

### How do I make plain boiled veggies taste good?
Two words: **Acid and Fat**. A squeeze of lemon juice (acid) and a drizzle of good olive oil (fat) + salt will make even plain boiled green beans taste gourmet.
