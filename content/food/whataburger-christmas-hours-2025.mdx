# Whataburger Christmas Hours: Can You Get a Patty Melt?

For Texans and burger lovers across the South, Whataburger is a way of life. But if you were hoping to grab a #1 with Cheese on Christmas Day, you might be out of luck.

## The Verdict: CLOSED
Whataburger is one of the few fast-food chains that closes its doors to observe the holiday.
*   **Christmas Day (Dec 25)**: **CLOSED** at most locations.
*   **Christmas Eve (Dec 24)**: Open, but typically closes early (often around 6:00 PM) to allow employees to be with family.

## When Do They Reopen?
Don't worry, the withdrawal won't last long.
*   **December 26**: Most locations resume normal 24-hour operations bright and early (usually 6:00 AM).

## Exceptions?
While corporate policy is to close, Whataburger franchises are independently operated. There is a *slim* chance a location near a major interstate might have limited hours, but we highly recommend calling ahead to avoid disappointment.

## Alternative?
If you need a burger *today*, try **Jack in the Box** or **McDonald's**, which have much wider availability on Christmas Day.
