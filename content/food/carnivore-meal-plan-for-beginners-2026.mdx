## The Economics of a Carnivore Meal Plan

Many beginners worry about the "Meat Budget." However, when you remove all the "vices" (snacks, alcohol, soda, expensive produce, dining out), the math often works in your favor.

| Expense Category | Typical Modern Diet | Carnivore Plan |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Coffee/Snacks    | $150 / mo           | $0             |
| Fresh Produce    | $200 / mo           | $0             |
| Meat/Protein     | $300 / mo           | $600 / mo      |
| Dining Out       | $400 / mo           | $50 / mo       |
| **Total Monthly**| **$1,050**          | **$650**       |

As shown in our **carnivore meal plan for beginners**, you can actually save $400 a month while eating the highest quality nutrition available.

## FAQ: Surving the First 30 Days

### What is the "Keto Flu"?
As your body dumps stored glycogen and water, it loses electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium). This can cause headaches and fatigue. The solution? **Eat more salt.** 

### Can I have coffee?
Strict carnivores avoid it because it's a plant. However, many beginners keep black coffee for the first 30 days to make the transition easier. 

### What about fiber and constipation?
This is a common fear. In reality, meat is almost entirely absorbed in the small intestine, leaving very little waste. You will have smaller, less frequent bowel movements, but this is not constipation (which is struggling to go). If you feel "stuck," increase your fat intake.
