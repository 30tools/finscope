# McDonald's 2025 Holiday Menu: The Grinch Steals the Show

This holiday season, the Golden Arches went full Whoville. **McDonald's** released its 2025 Holiday Menu, and it is headlined by a massive collaboration with Dr. Seuss: **The Grinch Meal**.

## What's in The Grinch Meal?
It’s not roast beast, but it’s close.
*   **Main**: Choice of a **Big Mac** or **10-piece McNuggets**.
*   **Side**: The all-new **Dill Pickle McShaker Fries**. (Yes, they are green-ish and tangy).
*   **Drink**: A medium soft drink.
*   **The Toy**: Every meal comes with a pair of exclusively designed **Grinch socks** or a collectible ornament.

## Returning Favorites
It wouldn't be Christmas without some classics.
*   **The McRib**: The elusive sandwich is back for its annual "Farewell Tour" (we know it'll be back next year, but we eat it anyway).
*   **Holiday Pie**: The custard-filled, sprinkle-topped pastry remains a fan favorite for dessert.

## Availability
This menu is available nationwide through December 31, 2025, or while supplies last. Initial reports suggest the Grinch socks are already selling out in major cities, so act fast if you want the merch!
