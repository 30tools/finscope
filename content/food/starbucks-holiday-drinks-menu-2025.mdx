# Starbucks 2025 Holiday Menu: Old Favorites & New Hits

The Red Cups are here. **Starbucks** rolled out its 2025 holiday lineup, and for the first time in four years, a fan-favorite has returned to the menu.

## The Comeback Kid: Eggnog Latte
After a controversial hiatus, the **Eggnog Latte** is back. Fans petitioned for years, and Starbucks finally listened.
*   **Taste**: Rich, creamy, and spiced with nutmeg. It's Christmas in a cup.

## The New Star: Iced Gingerbread Chai
Recognizing that Gen Z drinks iced coffee year-round (even in snowstorms), Starbucks launched the **Iced Gingerbread Chai**.
*   **The Build**: Chai concentrate, oatmilk, and a dairy-free gingerbread cold foam.
*   **The Verdict**: It’s already the top-selling new item of the season.

## Returning Classics
*   **Peppermint Mocha**: The undisputed king of holiday drinks.
*   **Caramel Brulée Latte**: Sweet, smoky, and topped with crunchy sugar bits.
*   **Chestnut Praline**: Subtle and nutty.

## Viral Trend: Dubai Chocolate
Looking ahead to January 2026, Starbucks confirmed it will add a **Dubai Chocolate Matcha Latte** (inspired by the viral pistachio kunafa chocolate bars) to the winter menu.
